The song was announced alongside the name and album art of Evolve via Twitter on May 9, 2017.


== Music video ==
A music video for the song was released on October 12, 2017. It was directed by Matt Eastin and Aaron Hymes. Eastin had also previously directed the music videos for Imagine Dragons' songs "On Top of the World", "Roots", and "Believer". The video begins with lead singer Dan Reynolds swimming through a room filled with water. You can see matchbooks reading "The Overlook Hotel" and "Mt. Qualo, Colorado, references to 'The Shining'. It then cuts to a scene in which Reynolds and the band are playing in the same room; however, it is not filled with water in this scene. As they perform the chorus of the song, the roof crumbles and rain starts pouring in. Throughout the video, the rain persists and the room eventually fills completely with water. However, the band still plays. As Reynolds sings, objects such as boxing gloves and keys float by him along with two people who are seemingly sirens, tugging at him from both sides. Before the final chorus, the music stops and the band floats lifelessly on the water. When they break into song again, the stage has completely changed as the room is no longer underwater, but on fire as the band plays on it. As the video ends, everything is on fire and the music stops. The video won the MTV Video Music Award for Best Rock Video award.

== Commercial performance ==
As of May 15, 2018, the song has peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100.
