Naked Attraction is a British television dating game show produced by Studio Lambert and broadcast on Channel 4. Hosted by Anna Richardson, the show premiered on 25 July 2016 and has aired twelve series. The series premise involves a clothed single person presented with a gallery of six nude potential partners, who are hidden behind differently colored booths that concurrently reveal themselves from the bottom up.
Two special series titled Best Naughty Bits have aired from 18 May 2021 to 15 June 2021, and from 6 to 20 April 2022, whilst special titled All Out & Proud aired on 23 June 2022. During its run, Naked Attraction has been the subject of numerous complaints to Ofcom for its full-frontal nudity, but Ofcom declined to perform an investigation due to the lack of sexual activity and the series' timeslot.


== Premise ==
A clothed person is faced with six naked people who are initially hidden in booths. Their bodies and faces are gradually revealed through successive rounds, from the feet up. At each round, the chooser eliminates one naked person until only two are left, when the chooser also takes off their clothes to make the final choice. The chooser then decides which person they wish to go out with, and the two (or, occasionally, three) then go for a fully clothed date.


== Production ==
One contestant reported that each episode can take up to twelve hours to film, although the contestant choosing a date only has to disrobe for fifteen minutes. The resultant date takes place at 9 a.m. the next day. The picker has to have someone with them at all times to make sure they do not accidentally bump into one of the contestants, and if one of the contestants needs a toilet break, they must be escorted out by a member of staff so the picker does not see them leave their coloured booth.
Contestants do not receive payment for participating, but standby contestants are given Â£75 for being in the room.


== Controversy ==
Numerous complaints about the programme were made by viewers to the broadcasting watchdog Ofcom due to the full-frontal nudity that is featured in the programme. Ofcom chose not to investigate as there was nothing that breached their rules: the show was purely a dating show and did not contain any sexual activity, and was shown after the watershed. It caused controversy when released in  the United States.
