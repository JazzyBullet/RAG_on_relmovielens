== Production ==
Dog on Trial is the directorial debut of French actress Laetitia Dosch, who wrote the film's screenplay with Anne-Sophie Bailly. It is loosely based a real-life story of a trial in France which centred on a dog that had repeatedly bitten strangers. Dosch was fascinated by how the case had captivated the entire village where it took place, where demonstrators protested the fact that the dog was treated by the law as an object rather than a living being. In the early stages of the film's development, Dosch briefly considered changing the subject the film after an encounter with filmmaker Justine Triet, who previously directed Dosch in the film Age of Panic (2013), and revealed to Dosch the premise of her next film Anatomy of a Fall (2023) which similarly centers on a trial, a child, a blind person and a dog.
The film is produced by Lionel Baier and Agnieszka Ramu for Bande à Part Films (Switzerland) and by Thomas and Mathieu Verhaeghe for Atelier de Production (France), in co-production with RTS Radio Télévision Suisse, SRG SSR and France 2 Cinéma.
