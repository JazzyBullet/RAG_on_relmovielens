From Hell I Rise is the debut solo album by Slayer guitarist Kerry King, released on May 17, 2024, through Reigning Phoenix Music. It is King's first album since disbanding Slayer in 2019, and its contributors include Mark Osegueda of Death Angel on vocals, former Vio-lence and Machine Head guitarist Phil Demmel, Hellyeah bassist Kyle Sanders, and Slayer and former Testament, Forbidden and Exodus drummer Paul Bostaph. The album's sound has been described as similar to Slayer.

Work on From Hell I Rise began as early as 2020, with King saying in an interview on the Dean Guitars YouTube channel that August that he had "more than two records' worth of music". King's Slayer bandmate and drummer Paul Bostaph stated that same month he and King were working on a new project that would "sound like Slayer without it being Slayer — but not intentionally so."
Progress on the album remained slow within the next three years. King said in a January 2024 interview with Metal Hammer magazine that it had been "done since June" 2023, with production handled by Josh Wilbur. About five months after its completion, King hinted that he was going to release the debut album by his new project in 2024; this project was later revealed to be his solo debut album. Details of the album, including its title, release date and lineup, were announced on February 5, 2024, and its first single "Idle Hands" was premiered on the same day.
