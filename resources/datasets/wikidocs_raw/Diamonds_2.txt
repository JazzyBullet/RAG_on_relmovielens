Diamonds, Diamonds is a "Greatest Hits" album by the Canadian rock band Max Webster. It was released in 1981 after the band had broken up, and features two new tracks: "Hot Spots" and "Overnight Sensation", which were recorded in 1975 during the debut album sessions. No songs from the band's fifth album, Universal Juveniles, are included on this album. An alternate version of "On the Road" from the High Class in Borrowed Shoes sessions was slated for release but pulled at the eleventh hour.
