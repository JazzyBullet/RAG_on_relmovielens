Family Plots is an American reality series that followed the events and employees at the family-run Poway Bernardo Mortuary in Poway, California. It ran for four seasons, beginning in 2004, on the A&E Network.


== Overview ==
The show centered on the relationships between the employees, in particular Chuck Wissmiller and his three daughters, all of whom worked together at the mortuary during the show's run.  Each episode featured one or two funerals with families who shared their grief while celebrating the life and contributions of their loved ones.  The departed themselves were seen from time to time on the show.  While the work done in the preparation room was also shown, the more graphic portions of mortuary work were limited.
The show was also aired on the Seven Network in Australia, in Canada, and Europe.
