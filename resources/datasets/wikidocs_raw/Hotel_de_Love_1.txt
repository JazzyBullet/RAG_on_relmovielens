== Principal cast ==


== Production ==
The film was the directorial debut of Craig Rosenberg, an Australian writer who had been making a living writing screenplays in Los Angeles. David Parker was producer. Rosenberg:

Working with David Parker was an absolute joy. He's so experienced; he has written, produced and shot feature movies. To have him as producer on my first feature was a remarkable luxury for me because, if I had a writing problem, I could throw it to him and say, 'What do you think about this? Read this page for me'. If I had some shooting problem I would say, 'What do you think about this?' as well as having him do his normal production responsibilities. So he was a real godsend. He was a dream and he's a lovely person and I think we've formed a long friendship out of the experience.

The film received mixed reviews.
