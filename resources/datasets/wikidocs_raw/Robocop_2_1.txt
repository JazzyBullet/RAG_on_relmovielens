RoboCop 2 is a 1990 American science fiction action film directed by Irvin Kershner and written by Frank Miller and Walon Green. It stars Peter Weller, Nancy Allen, Dan O'Herlihy, Belinda Bauer, Tom Noonan and Gabriel Damon. It is the sequel to the 1987 film RoboCop, the second entry in the RoboCop franchise and the last to feature Weller as RoboCop until he returned in Mortal Kombat 11, RoboCop: Rogue City and other media; it is also the last film Kershner directed before his death in 2010.
Set in a dystopian Detroit, the plot follows RoboCop (Weller) as he becomes embroiled in a scheme made by Omni Consumer Products to bankrupt and take over the city while also fighting the spread of a street drug called "Nuke" and its gang of dealers led by Cain (Noonan). The film was shot on-location in Houston.
The film received mixed reviews upon its release and earned a moderate box office return, grossing $45 million worldwide, compared to the previous film's $53 million gross on a significantly smaller production budget. It was nominated for three Saturn Awards, including Best Science Fiction Film, Best Performance by a Younger Actor (for Damon), and Best Special Effects (for Phil Tippett, Rob Bottin and Peter Kuran). A sequel, RoboCop 3, was released in 1993. Miller would return to write the comic book sequel RoboCop Versus The Terminator in 1992 and Steven Grant adapted his original screenplays for the second and third films into the comics Frank Miller's RoboCop from 2003 to 2006 and 2013 to 2014.


== Plot ==
In a near dystopian future, Detroit is nearing bankruptcy after failing to pay off its debts to conglomerate Omni Consumer Products (OCP). The OCP chairman intends to have the city default on its debt, then foreclose on all public property, effectively taking over its government and allowing for OCP's on-going, radical urban-redevelopment plan (as established in the first film). To rally public opinion behind the project, OCP deliberately sparks an increase in street crime by terminating the privatized Detroit Police Department's pension plans and cutting salaries, triggering a police strike.
RoboCop remains on duty with his partner Anne Lewis. They raid a manufacturing plant of Nuke, a new designer drug plaguing Detroit. The cartel's leader Cain and his prepubescent accomplice Hob escape. RoboCop has flashbacks to his previous life as Alex Murphy, and has begun watching his wife and son outside their new home. Still grieving over the death of her husband, his wife brings litigation against OCP, complaining of harassment. After his handlers dress him down, RoboCop tells his wife that Murphy is dead and he does not know her.
OCP struggles to develop RoboCop 2, a police droid fitted with the brains of legally-dead police officers, intended for mass production to replace the striking police force. The resurrected cops keep committing suicide upon activation. Morally-warped psychologist Dr. Juliette Faxx theorizes that Murphy's strong moral code and strict Catholic upbringing were critical in his initial success. She convinces the chairman to let her lead the project to recover their 90-million dollar research and development investment. The research staff are later horrified to learn that she seeks to use death row inmates, who desire power and immortality, rather than police officers.
Cain fears losing his grip after the Delta City project and uses corrupt police officer Duffy to undermine OCP and RoboCop's enforcement efforts. RoboCop tracks down Duffy and violently confronts him, revealing Cain's hideout. He confronts Cain's gang at an abandoned construction site, but he walks into a trap and is overwhelmed. The criminals cut apart RoboCop's body and dump the pieces in front of his precinct. Cain has Duffy vivisected for revealing their location and forces Hob to watch.
RoboCop is repaired, but Faxx intentionally reprograms him with more than 300 new directives that severely impede his ability to perform his duties so that he
