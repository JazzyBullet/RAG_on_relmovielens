MV Manxman is a new-build Ro-pax ferry which entered service with the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company (IoMSPCo) on 17 August, 2023.


== History ==


=== Order and construction ===
The ship was ordered on 31 July 2020 and was built by the Hyundai Mipo Dockyard, Ulsan, South Korea, being laid down on December 24, 2021. 
Construction commenced in the summer of 2021. On 1 December 2020, following a naming competition, it was announced that the ship would be named Manxman, the third vessel in the history of the line to bear the name.


=== Sea trials ===
Manxman started her first sea trials in December 2022. However, during the course of the trials a significant fault was found in the ship's gearbox. This necessitated a return to the shipyard where the gearbox was replaced.
The Sea Trials resumed in April and were carried out over the course of ten days in the Korea Strait between South Korea and the Japanese island of Tsushima. The trials involved various tests on the vessel's maneuverability, speed and fuel consumption with the tests proving satisfactory.


=== Naming ceremony ===
On May 3, 2023, Manxman officially received her name during a ceremony held at the Mipo Dockyard, the christening being performed by Ms. Geraldine Ugland. As is Isle of Man Steam Packet Company tradition, the name has been painted in gold and will remain so for the first year of her service.


=== Delivery ===
At 02:40hrs GMT, 11:40hrs local time, on May 11, 2023, Manxman was officially handed over when Chairman of the Board of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company, Lars Ugland, signed the official documentation to complete the transfer of ownership on behalf of the Company.
On Saturday May 13, under the command of Captain Andy Atkinson, Manxman departed Korea enroute to Southampton for additional fitting out prior to her commencement of service.
The delivery voyage of approximately 12,000 miles was originally planned to stage via Hong Kong, Singapore, Colombo, Muscat and Jeddah prior to transiting the Suez Canal, and then to Gibraltar and England.  However, an alteration enroute resulted in the stop at Gibraltar being cancelled and thus Manxman made passage through the Mediterranean via Malta which was her last port of call prior to reaching Southampton.
Manxman arrived at the pilot station off Douglas at 08:15hrs GMT on Sunday July 2. She was boarded by the senior pilot for the Port of Douglas, Captain Stephen Carter, before she proceeded to berth at No.5 Berth, King Edward VIII Pier. The occasion marked Capt. Carter's final duty prior to his retirement.


=== Official welcoming ceremony ===
Foremost of the celebrations around Manxman's arrival was her official Welcoming Ceremony, which took place at Douglas on Sunday July 9. The ceremony was performed by Mrs. Janice McDowall, Manageress of the Company's Liverpool Terminal. The formalities were streamed live to a big screen which had been constructed on Douglas Head in addition to which the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company's Managing Director, Brian Thomson, made a speech on the quayside, and at 11:15 local time the traditional champagne bottle was broken onto Manxmanâ€™s bow.
The occasion also saw the Chief Minister of the Isle of Man, Alfred Cannan MHK, given a guided tour of the ship.
The festivities concluded with a firework display in Douglas Bay and a sail past by the Manxman.


== Service ==
Following arrival at her home port, Manxman spent a period undergoing operating drills and docking procedures at the Port of Douglas. Part of this prelude to working up to operational efficiency saw Manxman make her first visit to the Port of Heysham on 11 July 2023.
Manxman commenced operational service on Thursday 17 August 2023 on the company's main schedule to Heysham, replacing Ben-my-Chree. The Company will retain Ben-my-Chree on a standby basis, to be in service during busy periods or when Manxman undergoes routine overhaul.
