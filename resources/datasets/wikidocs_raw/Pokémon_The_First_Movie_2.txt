Pokémon: The First Movie: Music From and Inspired By the Motion Picture is the soundtrack to the first Pokémon film in the North American markets. Some of the songs were featured in the animated short Pikachu's Vacation, and some songs did not feature in either the short or the movie at all. The CD contains extra features, such as Pokémon videos and a screensaver. When it was released, it included a promotion to send in a proof of purchase for an exclusive Jigglypuff card from the Pokémon TCG.
Alongside this soundtrack, the orchestral score from the movie was also released on the CD Pokémon: The First Movie Original Motion Picture Score.
The soundtrack was released on Atlantic Records, a sister company to Warner Bros., the film's distributor outside Japan.

== Sound Picture Box: The Birth of Mewtwo ==
Sound Picture Box: The Birth of Mewtwo (サウンドピクチャーボックス ミュウツーの誕生, Saundopikuchābokkusu myuutsū no tanjō) consists of two discs. The first disc contains episodes of the Japanese radio serial The Birth of Mewtwo (ミュウツーの誕生), released only in Japan and later adapted into The Uncut Story of Mewtwo's Origin. The second disc contains full score of the original Japanese release of the film in addition to two theme songs sung in Japanese.


=== Synopsis ===
The first three episodes of the drama mirror the anime short seen in The Uncut Story of Mewtwo's Origin, describing the circumstances behind Mewtwo's creation under a team of scientists and the tragic loss of his first friend, Amber. However, the last two episodes take place during the start of the first movie, after the prologue ends. The drama also goes into detail the leadership of Team Rocket under Madame Boss and the last known whereabouts of Miyamoto (ミヤモト), the mothers of Team Rocket members Giovanni and Jesse respectively.
