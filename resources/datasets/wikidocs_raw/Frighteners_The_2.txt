== Reception ==
Jason Ankeny, writing for AllMusic, complimented it as an "imaginative" score rating three stars of out five. Filmtracks.com rated 1-star to the album, saying "With the composer's previous ideas for the genre thrust together as a horror score package, The Frighteners is correctly identified by many mainstream listeners as lacking much cohesion or singular creativity."
Todd McCarthy of Variety commented that Elfman's score is "busily in your face and ears". Kenneth Turan of Los Angeles Times called the score as "spooky". Edward Guthmann of San Francisco Gate criticised Elfman's score as an "overmixed onslaught". In retrospect, Cody Hamman of JoBlo.com felt that the score was "done to perfection", while Alex Behan of Stuff called the score as "great". Reviewing for the director's cut, Michael Drucker of IGN wrote "the great Danny Elfman music also comes through really well".
