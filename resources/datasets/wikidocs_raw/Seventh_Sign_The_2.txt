The Seventh Sign is the seventh studio album by Swedish guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen, released on 9 May 1994.


== Reception and legacy ==

The Seventh Sign reached No. 11 on the Swedish albums chart and No. 47 on the Swiss albums chart, both in 1994. In July 2014, Guitar World magazine placed the album at No. 46 on their "Superunknown: 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994" list.
Steve Huey at AllMusic gave The Seventh Sign three stars out of five, saying that Malmsteen's extensive use of a wah pedal in the style of Jimi Hendrix makes the album "necessary for Malmsteen fans, even though his more neo-classical work (solos, instrumentals, etc.) seems less inspired here." He also heavily criticised the power ballad "Prisoner of Your Love", calling it "downright embarrassing."
