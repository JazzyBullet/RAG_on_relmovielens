== Plot ==
Woody Woodrow, a country bumpkin whose family makes and sells moonshine in backwoods Tennessee, inherits a Las Vegas casino and plans to turn it into a country and western bar. The rundown establishment is WAY out of town, but country music is a novelty they figure they can successfully promote.
On the plus side, buxom Boots Malone (Van Doren); who is smarter than she appears; signs on as hostess and business manager. On the minus side, gangsters to whom the previous owners owed a sizeable amount of money keep coming around to collect; backed by huge "enforcer" Richard Kiel.
Woody eventually manages to talk well-known country singers into appearing there; and pays off the debt.
Woody then orders his staff to shower the gangsters with pies on their way out  the door.
