== Legal issues ==
On April 10, 2007, Brown was pulled over by the police in Texas for driving without his headlights on. While searching his vehicle, they found marijuana in the side door and arrested him for marijuana possession. Brown denied that the marijuana belonged to him and stated that he had borrowed the vehicle from a friend.
On February 28, 2016, in Torrance, California, Brown was arrested and later charged with domestic battery, obstruction of justice, drug possession with intent to sell, and possession of contraband in jail, following an altercation with his then girlfriend in public. Police were called to the scene after he struck her in the parking lot of a police station and he was found by officers to be in possession of methamphetamine, a stimulant drug, at the time of the incident. Brown failed to appear for a scheduled court date in relation to the charges and a warrant was issued for his arrest; he was ultimately taken into custody by police on March 18, 2016, in Barstow, California, after police were called to a private residence in response to complaints of a domestic disturbance between Brown, his girlfriend, and his girlfriend's mother and subsequently faced additional charges of domestic battery, drug possession, and resisting arrest.
Following his release from jail in Barstow, he again failed to appear for a scheduled court date and a warrant was again issued for his arrest; he fled California for Nevada and was eventually apprehended by bounty hunters. On June 5, 2016, Brown was arrested in Las Vegas by police while leaving a local hotel known for prostitution and illegal drug sale and use. He refused to cooperate with officers after they stopped his taxicab, and a subsequent search found him to be in possession of methamphetamine and a pipe, and that he had an outstanding warrant for his arrest, in relation to one of his unresolved domestic battery charges. He was charged with drug possession, possession of drug paraphernalia, and resisting arrest.
Several months later, on September 2, 2016, Brown, recently released from a medical facility where he'd been hospitalized for undisclosed reasons, was arrested after breaking into Legends Restaurant & Venue, a Las Vegas establishment owned by his childhood friend Danny Boy, and attempting to change the locks. Police found Brown on the roof of the building, after security cameras showed him entering the building without permission.
In early 2016, Brown debuted to the public a new tattoo, that of his former That's So Raven co-star Raven-Symoné, on his neck. Later that year, he entered rehab, after an intervention from friends and family, but remained in the program only one week, and was photographed shortly after his release walking down the street barefoot, carrying a box of wine.
