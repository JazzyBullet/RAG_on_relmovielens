== Reception ==

The Fear of Fear received positive reviews from critics. Ali Shutler of Dork wrote "The Fear Of Fear is a tightly wound record that showcases a band growing in confidence and getting increasingly comfortable with what they are." Dannii Leivers of Metal Hammer wrote, "Spiritbox could have easily...[rushed] out Eternal Blue v2, but instead, this is the sound of a band deciding where they want to go, unaffected by the weight of expectation, and taking us along for the ride." Jordan Blum of Metal Injection stated, "its truncated duration prevents it from feeling as epic and substantial as Eternal Blue, but its masterful sequencing...still provide plenty of enticing and inventive connective tissues." Paul Brown writing for Wall of Sound felt that "Whether it’s the soul-crushing heavy hits or the softly delivered melodic rock songs, they always keep us guessing and they’re only getting better with each release they unleash."
The song, "Jaded", earned a Grammy nomination for Best Metal Performance.
