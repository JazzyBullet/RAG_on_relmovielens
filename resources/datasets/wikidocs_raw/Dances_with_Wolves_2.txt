Dances with Wolves is a 1988 American Civil War novel by Michael Blake. Originally written as an unsold spec script, it was converted into a novel at the behest of Kevin Costner; it was adapted into a film of the same name, directed by Costner, in 1990. Union Lieutenant John Dunbar finds himself stranded in the wilderness and comes to live with a tribe of Lakota Sioux people, soon taking the name Dances with Wolves. The novel and the film later came under criticism for similarity to Elliot Silverstein's A Man Called Horse.
On September 4, 2001, Michael Blake published The Holy Road, a sequel to Dances with Wolves; the story is set eleven years later, and deals with the increasing conflict between the Plains Indians and the white man, with tragic outcomes.
