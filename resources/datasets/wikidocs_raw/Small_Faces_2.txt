Small Faces were an English British beat band formed in 1965 by Steve Marriott, Ronnie Lane, Kenney Jones, and Jimmy Winston (who was soon replaced by Ian McLagan). Heavily influenced by American rhythm and blues, they later evolved into a psychedelic act before disbanding in 1969.
Despite the fact that they were together only four years, Small Faces' music output from the mid- to late sixties remains as notable as any British beat and psychedelic music of that era. AllMusic refers to them as "the best English band never to make it big in America". They received the Ivor Novello Outstanding Contribution to British Music "Lifetime Achievement" award in 1996.
