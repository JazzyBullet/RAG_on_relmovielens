== Critical reception ==
Dominic Umile of PopMatters gave the album a favorable review, saying, "Celestial Clockwork's mystifying backdrop is an example of Blueprint's ability to hold back as a producer when necessary, but is also an expansive assortment of psychedelic beats that naturally complement Illogic's sly, off-kilter approach."
Alex Henderson of AllMusic gave the album 3 stars out of 5, saying, "Illogic is one of rap's intellectuals, and the heritage that he brings to the table -- influences like De La Soul, Q-Tip, and Common -- makes for a more nuanced, lyrically complex hip-hop experience."
