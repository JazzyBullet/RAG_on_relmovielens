Lock, Stock... is a seven-part British television crime drama series, co-written and created by Guy Ritchie, as a spin-off from his 1998 film Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. The series first broadcast on Channel 4 on 29 May 2000 with a feature-length pilot, Lock, Stock and Four Stolen Hooves.
The series stars Daniel Caltagirone, Del Synnott, Scott Maslen and Shaun Parkes as close friends Moon, Jamie, Bacon and Lee, who run The Lock, a public house in London. Each episode focuses on the four friends attempting a different business venture, and the comedy of errors that ensues. Ralph Brown also stars as local gangland boss Miami Vice.

Lock, Stock... was Ginger Productions' first commission for television. The series prominently featured the use of the rhyming slang of London's East End, making it harder for some viewers to comprehend. In Australia, the series first aired in 2001 on ABC. In Portugal, the series first aired in 2005 on cable channel SIC Radical. In Germany, the series first aired on cable channel RTL Crime in 2011, under the title  Bube, Dame, KÃ¶nig, grAS  (which in turn, is the German title of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels).
