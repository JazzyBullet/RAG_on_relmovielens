== Release and reception ==
The album peaked at number seventy on the U.S. Billboard 200 and reached the fourteenth spot on the R&B albums chart. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic, while noting that the entire album was well-produced, stated that "there is a noticeable lack of memorable material, leaving the record as nothing but a pleasant genre exercise." Critic David Browne in an Entertainment Weekly article graded it a "B−", calling most of the soundtrack "more workmanlike than inspired," like the song "Later On" by Casual. However, Browne praised the Zhané remake of the 1970s disco song "Shame" (originally sung by Evelyn "Champagne" King) and R. Kelly's contributions to the album as the soundtrack's positives.
Billboard's Larry Flick said the single release of "Get the Girl, Grab the Money, and Run" "stirs up some troublesome soul", but called its B-side, two different versions of "Later On", "the real gem".
