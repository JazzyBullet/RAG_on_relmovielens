Across the Sea of Time is a 1995 American IMAX 3D adventure film produced and directed by Stephen Low, and written by Andrew Gellis. It stars Peter Reznick as a young Russian boy who travels to the United States in search of his ancestor's family.


== Plot ==
The plot centres around a real life Russian immigrant, searching for his family, who is given the name Leopold Minton by the Ellis Island immigration officials (because they are unable to pronounce his Russian name). Minton is employed by a company to take stereoscopic photographs for the (at that time) popular Holmes stereoscope. This provides the film with an opportunity to show many stereoscopic images, both past and present, of New York.
Minton, who had no fear of heights, produced an unrivalled collection of images of the development of New York's skyscrapers. Minton also documented the construction of New York's subway system. The film also includes a number of Minton's private stereo photographs that were not publicly released during his lifetime. Some of these images reveal how Minton was able to take some of the photographs of the skyscraper construction without actually standing on them.
