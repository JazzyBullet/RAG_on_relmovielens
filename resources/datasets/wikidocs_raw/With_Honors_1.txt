Latin honors are a system of Latin phrases used in some colleges and universities to indicate the level of distinction with which an academic degree has been earned.  The system is primarily used in the United States. It is also used in some Southeastern Asian countries with European colonial history, such as Indonesia and the Philippines, and African countries such as Zambia and South Africa, although sometimes translations of these phrases are used instead of the Latin originals. The honors distinction should not be confused with the honors degrees offered in some countries, or with honorary degrees.
The system usually has three levels of honor (listed in order of increasing merit): cum laude, magna cum laude, and summa cum laude. Generally, a college or university's regulations set out definite criteria a student must meet to obtain a given honor. For example, the student might be required to achieve a specific grade point average, submit an honors thesis for evaluation, be part of an honors program, or graduate early. Each school sets its own standards. Since these standards vary, the same level of Latin honors conferred by different institutions can represent different levels of achievement. Similarly, some institutions grant equivalent (or additional) non-Latin honors to undergraduates. The University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison, for example, has a series of plain English grading honors based on class standing. Some colleges and universities, notably including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Reed College, and Yale Law School, do not use honors at all.
These honors, when they are used, are almost always awarded to undergraduate students earning their bachelor's, and, with the exception of law school graduates, much more rarely to graduate students receiving their master's or doctorate degree. The honor is typically indicated on the diploma. Latin honors are often conferred upon law school students graduating as a Juris Doctor or J.D., in which case they are generally based upon class rank or grade point average.

==== Distinctions ====
In the United States, most colleges and universities use Latin honors for bachelor's degrees and for the Juris Doctor law degree. They are not normally used for any other degrees, such as master's degrees or the Ph.D. and M.D. degrees. There are three standard levels of Latin honors:

cum laude (English: ), meaning "with praise", typically awarded to graduates in the top 20%, 25%, or 33% of their class, depending on the institution.
magna cum laude (), meaning "with great praise", typically awarded to graduates in the top 5%, 10%, or 15% of their class, depending on the institution.
summa cum laude (), meaning "with highest praise", typically awarded to graduates in the top 1%, 2%, or 5% of their class, depending on the institution. Some institutions do not award the summa cum laude distinction or award it only in extraordinary circumstances.


==== History ====
In 1869, Harvard College became the first college in the United States to award final honors to its graduates. From 1872 to 1879, cum laude and summa cum laude were the two Latin honors awarded to graduates. Beginning in 1880, magna cum laude was also awarded. In his 1895 history of Amherst College, college historian William Seymour Tyler traced Amherst's system of Latin honors to 1881, and attributed it to Amherst College president Julius Hawley Seelye:

 In the UK, the Latin cum laude is used in commemorative Latin versions of degree certificates sold by a few universities (e.g. the University of Edinburgh) to denote a bachelor's degree with honors, but the honors classification is stated as in English, e.g. primi ordinis for first class rather than summa cum laude, etc.  Official degree certificates use English.

For undergraduate degrees, Latin honors are used in only a few countries such as Israel, Indonesia, th
