An academic year or school year is a period that schools, colleges and universities use to measure the quantity of study that are often divided into academic terms. During this period, students attend classes and do relevant exams and homework. It comprises school days and school holidays. Duration of school days, school year, and holidays vary across the world.


== Terminology ==


=== School days ===
A school day is a day when school is open. Governments often legislate on the total number of school days in a year for state schools.


=== School holidays ===
School holidays (also referred to as vacations, breaks, and recess) are the periods during which schools are closed or no classes or other mandatory activities are held. The dates and periods of school holidays vary considerably throughout the world, and there is usually some variation even within the same jurisdiction. The holidays given below apply to primary and secondary education. Teaching sessions (terms or semesters) in tertiary education are usually longer.


==== Easter vacation ====
In countries with a Christian religious tradition, the Easter holiday takes place in the northern spring. The date varies because Easter is a movable feast, but also by country and level of schooling.


==== Summer vacation ====
In the northern hemisphere, the longest break in the educational calendar is in the middle of the year, during the northern summer, and lasts up to 14 weeks. In Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, and Russia, summer holidays are normally three months, compared to six to eight weeks in Britain, the Netherlands, and Germany. In the southern hemisphere, the longest break in the educational calendar is in the end-beginning of the year, during the southern summer, and lasts up to 14 weeks, from December 21 to March 20.


== Common practices and effects ==
Traffic congestion and heavy passenger loads on public transport on school run routes may be worse on school days during term time.
Summer holidays for most children are a time to relax, enjoy themselves, catch up on studies, or spend time with family or relatives. Many families travel together on school holidays. School holidays have many effects on a country, ranging from the price of travel and holiday accommodation, which increase as demand increases while children are off school, to a change in crime rate. The number of families taking holidays away from urban areas can reduce traffic and use of public transport in cities while loading long-distance highways and means of transport.
In some countries where many families travel to their holiday destinations, such as the Netherlands, the start and end dates of school holidays in different regions are staggered to reduce the heavy traffic and pressure on means of transport that would otherwise occur on these dates.
