Scott Neal Wilson of Country Weekly gave the soundtrack a positive review, saying that its sound would "not only appeal to country fans[…]but also to a pop-rock audience pulled in by the movie's inspirational storyline." Giving the album 2 1⁄2 stars out of 5, Jim Ridley of New Country magazine wrote that "While each of the tracks is agreeable in its own right, together they're like a radio station you can't escape. When you hear a good track, you want to hear more from that artist; when you hear a dull track, you have no guarantee the next one won't be as lame." He praised the performances of John Anderson and Brooks & Dunn as the strongest.
