== Critical reception ==

Retropop awarded 4 stars to the album and commended the "broad range of influences" on it while noting that it 'steps outside of all preconceived notions of a ‘Gabrielle album’ and offers up a body of work that feels current and relevant to the singer as she stands today". Naomi Clark of The Independent rated the album 7 out of 10 and called it "a varied offering full of soulful tracks". However, she felt that the album "narrowly falls short of the magic of her 90s classics" and was specifically critical of the song "Sorry", calling it "distinctly unoriginal" and "a middling pop ballad at best".
