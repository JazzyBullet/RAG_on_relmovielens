The Chuckle Brothers were an English comedy double act comprising real-life brothers Barry David Elliott (24 December 1944 â€“ 5 August 2018) and Paul Harman Elliott (born 18 October 1947). They were known for their BBC children's programme ChuckleVision, which aired from 1987 to 2009 and celebrated its twenty-first series with a 2010 stage tour titled An Audience with the Chuckle Brothers.
