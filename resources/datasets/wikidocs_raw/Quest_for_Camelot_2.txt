== Reception ==

The game was met with some negative reception, as GameRankings gave it a score of 50%. Adam Cleveland of IGN summarized the game as "bad". He described its core mechanics as "boring"â€”walking between points and looking for objects. Cleveland noted Titus's reputation for games of poor quality, especially games with licensed content. He criticized the repetitive music, and said the only decent part of the game was its use of color. Allgame's Joe Ottoson criticized how gem collectibles were needed in order to save the game progress. He added that the gameplay was tedious and the menus poorly designed.
