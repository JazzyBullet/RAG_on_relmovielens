Gabriel Toledo de Alc√¢ntara Sguario (born May 30, 1991), better known as FalleN, is a Brazilian professional Counter-Strike 2 player for Furia Esports and former Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Counter-Strike: Source and Counter-Strike 1.6 player. In 2015 he was chosen the most influential person in Brazilian eSports. He was also nominated PC personality of the year by the eSports Industry Awards in 2016. He is the owner of Brazilian eSports organization Games Academy. During 2016 and 2017, Fallen was described as one of the top AWPers, in-game leaders, and overall players in the world. He is also known as one of the few CS2 players who use the AWP and in-game lead, at the same time.
FalleN and four other Luminosity Gaming teammates were involved in a contract dispute between SK Gaming and Luminosity, when they switched teams. Eventually the players transferred to SK.
Although winning their group stage in ELeague Season 1 while being favorites to take the tournament trophy, FalleN's SK Gaming team was ultimately removed from the competition, along with SK Gaming's former team. The players and teams had violated one of the league's transfer rules, and several other team owners also signed a petition to remove the players.
Since 2017, his teams have waned in success. Besides a stint with fellow major winners Stewie2K and Tarik in MiBR, Fallen played for various different all-Brazilian and mixed lineups, including a mostly North American Liquid roster, again with Stewie2K.
