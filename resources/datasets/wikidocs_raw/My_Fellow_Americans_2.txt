Segal directed Adam Sandler for the first time in Anger Management (2003), which also starred Jack Nicholson.  When asked by the BBC who was the most famous person in his contacts book, Segal replied, "I have to say, it's very obvious now, it's Jack Nicholson. I've kept his number on my speed dial just so I can show it to friends. I could call him up out of the blue, but I'm worried he might say 'Pete who?'"
Segal collaborated with Sandler again in 50 First Dates (2004), which also starred Drew Barrymore.
Segal collaborated with Sandler for the third time in The Longest Yard (2005), a remake of the 1974 film of the same name. The film has become the second highest grossing sports comedy in history.

== Personal life ==
When asked in a September 2014 interview by the BBC if he believes in God, Segal replied: "I do. I'm very spiritual and I'm Jewish by faith. I'm not a practising Jew, I'm more of a recreational Jew. I celebrate the holidays and I try to inform my kids about their heritage because I think we all at some point have to defend our heritage and if they get picked on I want them to know why."
