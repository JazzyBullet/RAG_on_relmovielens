In Deadline Hollywood, Damon Wise described Late Bloomers as "an intimate, defiantly female-fronted indie, showcasing an engaging and refreshingly vanity-free performance from Karen Gillan". Jason Bailey of The Playlist felt the film was predictable in places and had familiar tropes, but described it as "about as well-acted and enjoyable a version of this particular thing as you're likely to find." Samantha Bergeson of IndieWire gave the film a grade of D, writing that "the film doesn't open up in time to blossom into something great", and its "whispers of emotional depthâ€¦come too little and too late."
