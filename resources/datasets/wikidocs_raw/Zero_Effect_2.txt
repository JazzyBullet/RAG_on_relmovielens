Make in India is an initiative by the Government of India to create and encourage companies to develop, manufacture and assemble products made in India and incentivize dedicated investments into manufacturing. The policy approach was to create a conducive environment for investments, develop a modern and efficient infrastructure, and open up new sectors for foreign capital. The initiative targeted 25 economic sectors for job creation and skill enhancement, and aimed "to transform India into a global design and manufacturing export hub."


== History ==
Announced in 2014, "Make in India" had three stated objectives:

to increase the manufacturing sector's growth rate to 12-14% per annum;
to create 100 million additional manufacturing jobs in the economy by 2022;
to ensure that the manufacturing sector's contribution to GDP is increased to 25% by 2022 (later revised to 2025).
After the launch, India gave investment commitments worth ₹16.40 lakh crore (US$200 billion) and investment inquiries worth of ₹1.5 lakh crore (US$18 billion) between September 2014 to February 2016. As a result, India emerged as the top destination globally in 2015 for foreign direct investment (FDI), surpassing the United States and China, with US$60.1 billion FDI.
As per the current policy, 100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is permitted in all 100 sectors, except for Space industry (74%), defence industry (49%) and Media of India (26%). Japan and India had also announced a US$12 billion 'Japan-India Make-in-India Special Finance Facility" fund to push investment.
In line with the Make in India, individual states too launched their own local initiatives, such as "Make in Odisha", "Tamil Nadu Global Investors Meet", "Vibrant Gujarat", "Happening Haryana", and "Magnetic Maharashtra". India received US$60 billion FDI in FY 2016–17.
The World Bank's 2019 ease of doing business index acknowledges India's jump of 23 positions against its rank of 100 in 2017 to be placed now at 63rd rank among 190 countries. By the end of 2017, India had risen 42 places on the ease of doing business index, 32 places in the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index, and 19 notches in the Logistics Performance Index, thanks to recent governmental initiatives, which include converges, synergies and enables other important Government of India schemes, such as Bharatmala, Sagarmala, Dedicated Freight Corridors, Industrial corridors, UDAN-RCS, Bharat Broadband Network, Digital India.
The growth rate of manufacturing averaged 6.9% per annum between 2014–15 and 2019–20. The share of manufacturing dropped from 16.3% of GDP in 2014–15 to 14.3% in 2020–21, and dropped further to 14.1% in 2023-24.
Three capital acquisition proposals worth ₹4,276 crore were cleared for the government's Make-In-India scheme on January 10, 2023. Due to a lack of awareness of transparent legal protection and law enforcement, hesitated investors and slow progress are the main difficulties in building a business-friendly environment. With some big companies finally tried to fulfill "make in India" decades after, however, it did not achieve enough jobs as expected.
