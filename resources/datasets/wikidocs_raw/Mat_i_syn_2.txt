Maxim Gorky liked the story and recommended it to Nikolai Teleshov to be included into the literary anthology The People's Reading. Bunin included it into the collection called To the Edge of the World, in a massively revised version.
At the Khutor (Na khutore, На хуторе). Russkoye Bogatstvo, 1895, No.5, May. The story featured in two 1902 collections, To The Edge of the World and The Stories, originally as "The Fantasy Man" (Fantazyor, Фантазёр). In 1995 Gorky wrote to Anton Chekhov: "Started to read Bunin's stories. Occasionally he makes it good, but don't you feel he copies you? Фантазёр, as I see it, is written under your direct influence."
1893
News from Motherland (Vesti s Rodiny, Вести с родины). Russkoye Bogatstvo, Saint Petersburg, 1895, No.6, June, under the title "The Unexpected Thing" (Neozhidannost, Неожиданность). According to Vera Muromtseva-Bunina, the story's hero was a peasant friend of Bunin in his youth, who later fell victim to the all-Russian famine. ("The Life of Bunin", p. 84) The reviewer of Obrazovanye (Education) magazine (1902, No.12, December) called it "the finest of Bunin's pieces."
In the Foreign Place (Na tchuzhoi storone, На чужой стороне). Mir Bozhiy, 1895, No.4, April, as "Holy Night" (Svyataya notch, Святая ночь).
1894

Zverev, a statistician who invited Bunin to the settlement used by the local villagers as a base during their trips to the Ussuri krai. "Critics praised the story so high that... the Saint Petersburg Society of Care for the Re-settlers invited me to read a lecture. I read To the Edge of the World, of course," he wrote. The story was also included into the Primal Love collection.
The  Teacher (Utchitel, Учитель). Novoye Slovo, 1896, No.7, April, as "Tarantella", subtitled: "From the life of the rural intelligentsia". "The story is true to life and sad is its final... Bunin surely knows the Russian village well, sympathises with its people but, most importantly, is able to convey their moods without pomposity or sentimentality," Russkaya Mysl (1897, No.5, May) reviewer commented.
1895
In the Field (V Pole, В поле). Novoye Slovo, 1896, No.3, December, originally as "Baibaki". Included into the Primal Love collection.

Holy Mountains (Svyatyie Gory, Святые горы). The date of the first publication of the story is unknown. As "On Donets" (Na Dontse, На донце), it featured in To the Edge of the World collection.
