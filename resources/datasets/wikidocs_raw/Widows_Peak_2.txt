== Story ==
In the 1920s, just after the First World War, in a small rural Irish village named Kilshannon, Edwina Broome, a young American war widow, has moved into the neighbourhood known as "Widows' Peak", named for the prevalent marital status of the residents, who are a rather exclusive group of middle-aged widows. All of the residents are curious about their new neighbour, Edwina, but information is not available about her, even for the leader of the place, Mrs. Doyle Counihan, whose son, Godfrey, is busy attempting to attract Edwina. The local spinster Miss Katherine O'Hare and Edwina immediately dislike each other, however, and soon some accidental encounters begin to look like Edwina is trying to ruin her new rival. The problems escalate and the town is in an uproar, but they get no closer to solving the mystery of the newcomer.

== Production notes ==
The film was mainly shot on location in the counties of Wicklow, Dublin and Kilkenny. The house used during production was that of Stonehurst, Killiney Hill Road, County Dublin. The concept for the film came from its co-producer Prudence Farrow. While it had been intended for her mother Maureen O'Sullivan to play the role of Miss O'Hare, the part went to O'Sullivan's daughter and Prudence's sister Mia Farrow. O'Sullivan declined the part due to her advanced age and dwindling stamina.
Set in the 1920s, the film's period wardrobe needs were handled by Angels and Bermans as well as Costumi d'Arte and European Costume Company. Consolata Boyle was the costume designer.


== Reception ==
The film was well received by critics and the public. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times said, the film "uses understated humor and fluent, witty speech; it's a delight to listen to, as it gradually reveals how eccentric these apparently respectable people really are."
The film grossed $0.3 million in the United Kingdom and Ireland and $6.2 million in the United States and Canada.


== Awards ==
In 1995, the actress Natasha Richardson received the Crystal Globe award at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, Czech Republic, for her role in this film. The director, John Irvin, was also nominated for this award. It received the best picture award at the 1995 Austin Film Festival.
