== Music video ==
The music video for "She's So Lovely" is set in a bowling alley. Roy Stride is trying to attract the attentions of a pretty girl (Louise Glover), but she has a boyfriend (Liyo Cassini) already. While the boyfriend is there, Roy tells the girl she looks beautiful. The boyfriend gets angry, but gets called away for his throw. As he scores a strike, Roy and the girl walk off down the hall together (although only their legs are shown, the shoes and jeans are the same as Roy's).
