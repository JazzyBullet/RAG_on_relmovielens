This list of countries by life expectancy provides a comprehensive list of countries alongside their respective life expectancy figures. The data is differentiated by sex, presenting life expectancies for males, females, and a combined average. In addition to sovereign nations, the list encompasses several non-sovereign entities and territories. The figures serve as an indicator of the quality of healthcare in the respective countries and are influenced by various factors, including the prevalence of diseases such as HIV/AIDS. This article introduces the concept of Healthy life expectancy (HALE), which denotes the average number of years a person is expected to live in "full health". There are challenges in comparing life expectancies across countries due to disparities in data reporting and collection standards. The primary source of the most recent data presented is the World Bank Group's 2021 report.


== Methodology ==
The life expectancy is shown separately for males and for females, as well as a combined figure. Several non-sovereign entities and territories are also included in this list.
The figures reflect the quality of healthcare in the countries listed as well as other factors including HIV infections.
From the beginning of the current century there is a tendency to also estimate Healthy life expectancy (HALE), the average number of years that a person can expect to live in "full health".
Comparing life expectancies across countries can be problematic. For example, due to poor reporting in some countries and various local standards in collecting statistics. This is especially true for Healthy life expectancy, the definition of which criteria  may change over time, even within a country. For example, Canada is a country with a fairly high overall life expectancy at 81.63 years; however, this number decreases to 75.5 years for Indigenous people in the country. This discrepancy is echoed in most quality of life metrics across Canada.


== World Bank Group (2021) ==
Estimation of the World Bank Group for 2021. Only countries with populations over 50,000 are listed. The values in the World Bank Group tables are rounded. All calculations were done on raw data, therefore, due to the nuances of rounding, in some places illusory inconsistencies of indicators arose, with a size of 0.01 year.


== United Nations (2022) ==
Shown is the "period life expectancy" at birth. This is the average number of years a newborn would live if age-specific mortality rates in the current year were to stay the same throughout its life. The data is taken from the 2020, 2021/2022 and 2023/2024 United Nations World Population Prospects. It is also used to calculate the Human Development Index. Only countries with populations over 50,000 are listed. Due to this criterion, the table does not include such countries as Monaco (LE 86.9 years, population 39,000) and Liechtenstein (LE 84.7 years, population 40,000). By default, the list is sorted by 2022. Data for 2021 can also be viewed via Our World in Data.


== World Health Organization (2020) ==
According to data published by the World Health Organization in December 2020. By default, data is sorted by life expectancy at birth for all population, and in case of equal values by HALE for all population.


== CIA World Factbook (2022) ==
The US CIA published the following life expectancy data in its World Factbook.


== OECD (2022) ==
Estimation of OECD for 2022. By default, the list is sorted by 2019.
