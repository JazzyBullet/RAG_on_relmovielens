== Background ==
The album was originally set to feature no guests and showcase Snoop Dogg only, hence the title "Ego Trippin'". However, Snoop Dogg proved this concept untrue as he scheduled tracks with the likes of Charlie Wilson, among others. All of the photography was taken at Long Beach Polytechnic High School, Snoop's high school. Snoop Dogg also went on to admit he used ghostwriters for this album, such as American rapper Problem, among others: I was watching Diana Ross get inducted into a Hall of Fame, and she got up there and named all of these great songwriters. Her biggest songs were written by somebody else. So I’m thinking, Wow, there’s nothing wrong with my pen, but I’m going to let other people write for me
Snoop Dogg originally confirmed that Pharrell, Nelly and Charlie Wilson would appear on a track entitled "Feet Don't Fail Me Now", and that he also would like to work with Bono, Madonna and Mick Jagger as well. However, "Feet Don't Fail Me Now" and none of the collaborations would make the final album cut except for Charlie Wilson's features. Collaborations with DJ Quik, Raphael Saadiq, Teddy Riley and Too Short were also scheduled for the album. Snoop Dogg formed a production supergroup for the album called "QDT" (Quik-Dogg-Teddy).
Snoop Dogg spoke on working with Everlast for a country song called "Johnny Cash". However, the track's title was changed to "My Medicine" with Everlast playing the guitar. Another track with Charlie Wilson and The Gap Band called "Can't Say Goodbye" was also confirmed for the album. Snoop Dogg reminisced on the track stating, "This song makes me want to cry every time I hear it. It is a reflection of my life and how I have grown as not only an artist but also a man - it is about me staying true to where I came from while having to accept where I am in my life today, it's deep".
Snoop Dogg and Charlie Wilson both performed 'Can't Say Goodbye' on American Idol's 'Idol Gives Back' Charity Performance. On July 29, 2008 BET's 106 & Park premiered Snoop Dogg's video for "Those Gurlz".
Track 2, "Press Play" was featured in the video game Midnight Club: Los Angeles.


== Critical reception ==

Rolling Stone said, "[H]is languorous rapping has a way of inspiring inventively freaky sounds from producers... Result: the best Snoop disc in years."
Entertainment Weekly said, "All of Snoop's personalities make appearances on his ninth CD, Ego Trippin'....It's sentimental, it's fun... Maybe this old Dogg doesn't need any new tricks." Vibe said, "Lead single 'Sensual Seduction' is an undeniable masterpiece of throwback funk."
