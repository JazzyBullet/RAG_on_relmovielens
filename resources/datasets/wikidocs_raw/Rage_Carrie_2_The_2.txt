== Novel ==

In the novel, which was King’s first work, a slightly overweight, shy, and usually bullied girl named Carietta Nadine White is being raised by Margaret, an unstable religious fanatic who thinks almost everything could be sinful. The book describes an odd incident of her exhibiting signs of telekinesis as a child, before focusing on her as a teen in high school; when she gets her first period in the shower, she panics as Margaret never taught her to prepare for having a period. Popular girls Christine Hargensen and Susan Snell ringlead the other girls to chant "period" and stare at Carrie. A few of the girls even throw tampons, further confusing Carrie, who believes she is dying. The gym teacher, Rita Desjardin, punishes the girls with a week of detention and suspends Chris when she refuses to comply. Desjardin also sends Carrie home with Margaret, believing Carrie should confront her mother about never being taught about a period. Margaret locks Carrie in the 'praying closet', as Margaret believes that periods are a symbol of a sexual sin on Carrie's part. However, she lets Carrie out much earlier than she does normally, and Carrie believes it is because her mother is aware of her awareness of her own powers.
Meanwhile, Chris feels as if she should not be suspended and decides to have revenge on Carrie. Sue, however, feels bad about her part in the incident and wants to apologize, but is too nervous to do so. Sue tells her boyfriend Thomas Ross to ask Carrie to prom, noting that Carrie has a crush on him “like half the girls in the school”. Carrie originally thinks that the invitation was a means of tricking her, but Tommy pleads, and Carrie realizes that his invitation is genuine and accepts; she then sews herself a beautiful white dress for prom. Meanwhile, Chris and her boyfriend Billy Nolan collect pigs’ blood in a bucket and hang it over the auditorium stage. Chris employs her friend Tina Blake to make fake Prom Queen ballots with Carrie’s name on them so that the blood will dump on Carrie and humiliate her. On prom night, Margaret initially forbids Carrie to attend prom, claiming that Tommy and the others will laugh at her, but Carrie is tired of her mother controlling her life and shoves her mother into the ‘praying closet’ with her powers. At prom, the blood is dumped on Carrie, but in the process the bucket holding the blood hits Tommy on the head, causing him to die of blood loss.
Carrie flees, saddened, but then remembers her powers and locks the prom doors with them. She loses herself in her moment of vengeance and causes a fire in the school. She also thwarts any attempt to put out her fire, killing multiple students and teachers. Carrie returns home, destroying the town as she goes, where Margaret tells Carrie how she was conceived: through a bizarre form of marital rape. Margaret then comes to the conclusion that Carrie's powers come from Satan and stabs her with a knife. Carrie telekinetically stops Margaret's heart in an attempt to save herself, but is immediately regretful of this and of all she has done. Carrie attempts to flee, but she is bleeding so heavily from the stab wound that she can barely walk. Sue finds Carrie, and after a brief telepathic conversation, Carrie forgives Sue. Soon after, Carrie dies crying out to her mother.
