Foolishness is the inability or failure to act following reason due to lack of judgment, stupidity, stubbornness, etc. The things such as impulsivity and/or  influences may affect a person's ability to make  reasonable  decisions. Other reasons of apparent foolishness include naivety, gullibility, and credulity. Foolishness differs from stupidity, which is the lack of intelligence.  An act of foolishness is called folly. A person who is foolish is called a fool.  The opposite of foolishness is prudence.
