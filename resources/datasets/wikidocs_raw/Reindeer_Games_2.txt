Big Brother Reindeer Games is a reality competition television series and spin-off of the American version of Big Brother. It premiered on CBS on December 11, 2023, and is hosted by former Big Brother HouseGuests Derek Xiao, Tiffany Mitchell, and Jordan Lloyd. The series features nine former HouseGuests competing against each other across six episodes which are airing over the course of two weeks.


== House ==
The house used for Big Brother Reindeer Games was renamed to the Santa's Lodge under the holiday-theme. The entryway of the house is decorated with flying reindeer, gold-wrapped presents, and a red flannel rug. The living room has a Christmas tree decorated with ornaments and wreaths. The kitchen, which in this season was named "Mrs. Claus Bakery", has red and green wallpaper with Christmas symbols, and gingerbread men on the counters.


== Format ==
Each episode will consist of three games and will end in a "Santa's Showdown", the outcome of which determines the elimination of one HouseGuest.  The players will not live in the BB house, will not live together, and there will be no voting off of other players. Four HouseGuest will remain in the finale with one winning a $100,000 grand prize.


=== Format changes and additions ===
Unlike the previous seasons of Big Brother, Reindeer Games won't involve any nominations, house-voted evictions or live broadcasts. Instead, the nine houseguests from previous seasons would compete in a series of holiday-themed daily challenges.


==== Naughty and Nice Challenge ====
In this challenge, the houseguests would compete to gain an advantage for the next challenge, while simultaneously, giving a disadvantage for a houseguest of their choosing, also known as the Naughty List Punishment.


==== Jingle Bell Brawl Challenge ====
The winner, or winners, of this challenge, would receive safety from elimination.


==== Santa's Showdown ====
The nominees would compete against each other in various challenges to determine who would stay in the lodge and who would be eliminated from the game.

The losing houseguest would get to choose a present under the Christmas tree that contains gifts from a fruit cake to $5,000.


== HouseGuests ==
The HouseGuests were revealed intermittently throughout December 6 and 7, 2023.

In May 2023 Deadline Hollywood reported that CBS was considering an additional season of Big Brother in the 2023-24 television schedule, with "all-star contestants", to fill in gaps left by the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike and the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike. CBS had previously done the same with Big Brother 9 which aired in 2008 to combat the 2007â€“08 Writers Guild of America strike.
Ahead of the Big Brother 25 finale in November 2023, host Julie Chen Moonves teased a "holiday surprise" from the "Big Brother universe". In an interview following the episode, Chen Moonves stated that a fourth season of Celebrity Big Brother was unlikely to happen, but noted the possibility of a shortened season with returning players. The Writers Guild of America strike ultimately ended in October, followed by the end of the SAG-AFTRA strike in November 2023. With most scripted series set to begin filming shortened seasons in late-November and early-December, and most premiere dates not expected until 2024, there were still empty slots in the schedule.
