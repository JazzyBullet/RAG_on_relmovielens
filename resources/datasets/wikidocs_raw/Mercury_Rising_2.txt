Mercury Rising is an annual professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event currently produced by the World Wrestling Network (WWN) under the name WWNLive Supershow: Mercury Rising. The event takes place during WrestleMania weekend, at a venue in the same metropolitan area the WrestleMania is held, and features talent from WWN's affiliate promotions, including EVOLVE, Full Impact Pro and SHINE.
From 2010 to 2014, Mercury Rising events were promoted by WWN affiliate Dragon Gate USA. In December 2014, WWN confirmed they were putting the Dragon Gate USA brand on an indefinite hiatus.
