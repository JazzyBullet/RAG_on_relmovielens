== Writing ==
Taffin's influences on his writing style were Elmer Keith and Skeeter Skelton.  His first article appeared in the November 1967 edition of GUNsport.  He wrote several other articles for the magazine until it ceased publication in 1969.  Taffin went on to write for JD Jones's newsletter for Handgun Hunters International called The Sixgunner and Elgin Gates's newsletter for International Handgun Metallic Silhouette Association (IHMSA) titled The Silhouette in 1979.  Taffin's first article for Guns magazine appeared in the December 1983 issue and in May 1984 he became a staff writer for the publication.  In 1985, he became a staff writer for their sister publication: American Handgunner. Taffin  published detailed review and handloading data on 22TCM in GUNS Magazine twice: in 2017 focused on powder loads; and 2023 focused more on different projectiles.
