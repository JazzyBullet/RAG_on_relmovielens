== Plot ==
Seth is a youth with artistic leanings, a rural white young man with a fascination with black pop culture, and a dead-end life in an Adirondack village. He's alternatively sensitive and brutal with Kristen, who wants a sexual relationship that he explosively rejects.
Late one night, as he's closing the cafe where he works, a young black man, called Knowledge, attempts to rob him at gun point, but faints from illness. Seth takes the man, who is an escapee from a nearby local youthful offender boot camp. He nurses him in a family cabin and they begin a tentative friendship. When the sheriff learns of Seth's harboring a fugitive, a confrontation looms. Relationships between fathers and their children dominate the subplots
