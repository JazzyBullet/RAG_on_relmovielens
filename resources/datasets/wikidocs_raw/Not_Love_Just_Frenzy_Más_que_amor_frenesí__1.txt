== Synopsis ==
Más que Amor... Frenesí tells the story about characters that we might find anywhere, in a supermarket, in a shopping center in Caracas, just about anywhere in any city. This group of adults who love each other with a frenzy and for that reason their relationships become too complex for them to love each other. Their daily lives, their struggles to achieve their dreams drive the plot to the point where it elicits audience laughter... or tears. There are several love stories – different, complex, sweet, some not so fortunate, lived and suffered by people who in spite of their pain never stop seeing a new day as a new opportunity in their lives, and things will work out.
