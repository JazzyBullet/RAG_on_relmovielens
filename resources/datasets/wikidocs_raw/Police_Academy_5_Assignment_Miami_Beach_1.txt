== Plot ==
Captain Harris finally finds a way to become Commandant of the Police Academy; the incumbent Commandant Lassard is past due for mandatory retirement. Meanwhile, Lassard is chosen as "Police Officer of the Decade," he brings his favorite graduates—Sgts. Hightower, Jones, Tackleberry and Hooks, Lt. Callahan, and new graduate Officer Thomas "House" Conklin—to the National Police Chiefs Convention in Miami Beach to celebrate with him.  His retirement is postponed until after his return. While there, they meet his nephew, Sgt. Nick Lassard of the Miami Police Department. Lassard unwittingly takes a bag belonging to jewel thieves containing stolen diamonds.
As the jewel thieves try to get the bag back, Captain Harris tries to prove to Commissioner Hurst he should replace Commandant Lassard, the usual hi-jinks ensue, including Lassard trying to guess the annual procedural demonstration. When the jewel thieves kidnap Commandant Lassard, he goes willingly, thinking it part of the convention. A negotiation is botched by Captain Harris, getting himself captured as well. A chase across the Everglades ensues to rescue the oblivious Commandant.
In a standoff with the smugglers, Nick explains to his uncle it is not a demonstration and that his kidnappers are in fact real criminals. Upon hearing this, Lassard promptly disarms and subdues his assailants to the amazement of all the officers. At a ceremony at the end of the film, Commissioner Hurst announces that Commandant Lassard will be allowed to continue his duties as Commandant until he sees fit to retire, and Hightower is promoted to Lieutenant for saving Harris's life during the rescue.
Lassard is seen proudly graduating the new class. As revenge for Harris' earlier sabotage against his uncle, Nick intentionally moves the chair away from Harris. Proctor tries to help him, but kicks the chair too hard and sending both it and Harris on a collision into the drum set. As the police marching band walks off in parade, Harris is seen screaming for Proctor's help.
