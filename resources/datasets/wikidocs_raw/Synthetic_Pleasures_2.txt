Luxor Las Vegas is a casino hotel on the southern end of the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada. The resort is owned by Vici Properties and operated by MGM Resorts International. The Luxor features an ancient Egyptian theme, and includes a 65,214-square-foot (6,058.6 m2) casino and 4,407 hotel rooms. The resort's pyramid is 30 stories and contains the world's largest atrium by volume, measuring 29 million cu ft (0.82 million m3). The tip of the pyramid features a light beam, which shines into the night sky and is the most powerful man-made light in the world.
The Luxor was developed by Circus Circus Enterprises at a cost of $375 million. Construction began on April 21, 1992, and the resort opened on October 15, 1993, with 2,526 rooms. A renovation and expansion project, costing $300 million, took place from 1996 to 1997. The project included the addition of two 22-story hotel towers, as well as Nevada's first 3D IMAX theater. The Egyptian theme was scaled back as well, including the removal of an indoor Nile River ride.
MGM acquired the Luxor in 2005. The company launched a $300 million renovation two years later, further scaling back on the Egyptian theme while adding new restaurants and clubs. An esports arena was added in 2018, the first to open on the Strip. The Luxor has hosted various entertainers, including comedian Carrot Top, the Blue Man Group, and magician Criss Angel.


== History ==


=== Construction and opening ===

The resort was announced by Circus Circus Enterprises on November 14, 1991. Known temporarily as "Project X", the pyramid-shaped resort would be built on the Las Vegas Strip. Groundbreaking took place on April 21, 1992, with the project by then known as "Luxor", after the Egyptian city of the same name.
Veldon Simpson was the architect, while Yates-Silverman, Inc served as interior designer. President and owner Charles L. Silverman traveled to Egypt three times to study the country's atmosphere. Of all the casino resorts that his firm had designed, Silverman called the Luxor "the most interesting and difficult". Before the ancient Egyptian theme was chosen, Yates-Silverman had suggested developing the land with a moat and a real riverboat casino to traverse it. Egyptologists were hired to create and oversee the Luxor's theme, which was prevalent throughout the resort. The interior included replicas of various Egyptian artifacts, made of fiberglass and plaster.
Perini Building Company served as general contractor. The project employed more than 150 contractors and 3,500 construction workers, several of whom died while building the resort. Waltek, a Cincinnati-based company, provided the metal-and-glass exterior for the pyramid. Standing 30 stories high, it was one of the largest metal-and-glass projects ever. The pyramid was topped off on July 9, 1993.
The Luxor cost $375 million to build. The resort was financed using internal cash flow from other Circus Circus properties and did not include any outside financial investors. Circus Circus chairman William Bennett said the most challenging aspect of construction was dealing with Clark County officials, who he felt were overly critical of the resort due to its pyramid shape. He claimed county regulations, including improved fire precautions, added unnecessary costs to construction.
The Luxor hosted a pre-opening event for hundreds of invited guests on the night of October 14, 1993. It opened to the public the following day at 4 a.m., welcoming thousands of people. It would compete against two other upcoming resorts, MGM Grand and Treasure Island. All three resorts had a family-oriented focus. The Luxor employed 4,500 workers.
Tupac Shakur, who was fatally shot in Las Vegas in 1996, had been staying at the Luxor during his visit to the city, although his injuries sustained from the drive by shooting occurred four miles from the resort.
