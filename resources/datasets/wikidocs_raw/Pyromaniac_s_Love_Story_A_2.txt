She has described her childhood as a "chaotic but positive experience". She spent much of her youth in Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, after her parents separated. Her parents had six relationships between them, which gave her ten siblings, including fellow actresses Holly Davidson and Jade Davidson; primary school teacher Jessi Frost; brothers called Gabriel Jupiter and Tobias Vaughan; and a sister named Sunshine Purple Tara Velvet.
Frost attained a scholarship to attend the Italia Conti Academy. In 2019, she furthered her education, by taking a master’s degree in film production.

She played the part of Rebecca in the 1989 film Diamond Skulls (also known as Dark Obsession), alongside Amanda Donohoe, and Gabriel Byrne.

In 2004, she wrote, presented, and produced a short-lived series What Sadie did next... for E4, and in 2006 appeared in Eating with... Sadie Frost on BBC2, to talk about her switch to vegetarianism.
