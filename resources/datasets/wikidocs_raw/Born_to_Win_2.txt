== Composition ==
We hope they'll [listeners] be inspired listening to the songs. We hope they'll [listeners] be able to feel their journey and not just hear or see their journey.
P-Pop group BINI flexes vocal complexity, thematic maturity, and moving sentiments with their debut studio album, Born to Win. [It] is a well-crafted and well-intended debut album that may just have served BINI a more proper and stronger take-off into reaching a higher level in their fast-developing career. Their feathery and flexible vocals are already truly magical assets that make this entire 12-track album noteworthy, but what their songs impart is an even more relevant goldmine.
True to its name, BINI's Born to Win debut album wants to make the listener feel like they can take on any challenge in life. It’s a well-produced album. The group's exploration into the funk and disco sound really suited them well and the group's vocals are stunning, as in they served in that department.
