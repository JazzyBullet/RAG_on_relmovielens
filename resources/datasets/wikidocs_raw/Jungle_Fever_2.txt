Jungle Fever is a soundtrack album by American R&B singer-songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist Stevie Wonder, recorded for the film Jungle Fever. It was released by the Motown label on May 28, 1991.
Jungle Fever became Wonder's ninth album, and fifth in a row, to reach No. 1 on the Billboard R&B Albums chart. Three singles were released from the soundtrack: the first and the biggest hit single was "Gotta Have You" (Hot 100 No. 92, R&B No. 3), with the second single "Fun Day" (R&B No. 6, UK No. 63) and the final single "These Three Words" (R&B No. 7).


== Critical reception ==

Jungle Fever received lukewarm reviews from critics. Reviewing for Entertainment Weekly in 1991, Bill Wyman said the album lacks worthwhile hooks and lyrics, and that Wonder's style of arrangement sounds "more and more dated as the years go by". In a positive review, Rolling Stone magazine called Jungle Fever a "welcome return to form" and said that Wonder has not "sounded so freewheeling, confident and engaging" since his 1980 album Hotter Than July. The Chicago Tribune wrote that it is "as direct and consistently tuneful as anything he has done in recent years". Robert Christgau of The Village Voice cited "Fun Day" and the title track as highlights and referred to Wonder as "a genius even if that's what he's selling".
In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine cited Jungle Fever as "Wonder's best work in years ... a considerable improvement from his bland late-'80s albums", although he said Wonder can be too sentimental on ballads such as "These Three Words". J. D. Considine wrote in The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004) that it is "lightweight but likeable". In his 2000 Consumer Guide book, Christgau gave the album a three-star honorable mention, which indicated "an enjoyable effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well treasure".
