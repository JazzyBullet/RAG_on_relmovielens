== Synopsis ==
Dr. Bill Cortner is a brilliant doctor that has gone mad after decapitating his fiancée Jan in a car accident. He steals her head and succeeds in reanimating it, much to Jan's horror. Cortner is not content with merely bringing her head back to life—he wants to give her an all new body, but must resort to unsavory and deadly measures to obtain one.

Technicalities be damned, I had fun watching this movie." Starburst was more critical, questioning "what’s the thinking behind doing an almost shot-for-shot version of a 1962 cult favourite rather than attempt to better it?"
