Theodore Rex, also known as T. Rex, is a 1996 buddy cop science-fiction comedy film written and directed by Jonathan Betuel and starring Whoopi Goldberg. Though originally intended for theatrical release, the film went direct-to-video, and consequently became the most expensive direct-to-video film ever made at the time of its release.
The film was not well-received, and saw Whoopi Goldberg being nominated for Worst Actress at the 1996 Golden Raspberry Awards. It is the first direct-to-video movie to receive any sort of Razzie nomination.

== Reception ==
Theodore Rex received negative reviews from critics and audiences. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 0% of 5 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 1.7/10. Variety magazine gave the film a negative review, saying, "This is one T. rex that wonâ€™t be spared the tar pits." William Thomas of Empire magazine gave the film a one out of five stars and said, "Steer Clear".
In a 2015 interview with the Brazilian newspaper Folha de S.Paulo, Goldberg stated that this is the only film she regrets ever having done: "Don't ask me why I did it, I didn't want to", she said. Goldberg also said it made "no sense to anybody to like it".


== Goldberg lawsuit ==
Though Whoopi Goldberg had made an oral agreement to star in the film in October 1992, she attempted to back out. Abramson filed a US$20 million lawsuit against Goldberg, which was settled quickly. Goldberg agreed to star in the film for $7 million, $2 million more than the amount originally agreed upon.
One of the attorneys on the case described this as being similar to the legal battle of Kim Basinger when she backed out of the film Boxing Helena.


== Distribution ==
The film was originally intended for theatrical release in North America during Christmas 1995, but a glut of competition as well as a rush on post production work for the effects heavy film led to New Line Cinema delaying release. They subsequently intended to release it to coincide with Goldberg's hosting stint at the Academy Awards the following year, but ultimately decided that it was in their best interests to release the film direct-to-video. This decision came as a result of failed test marketing in Las Vegas, Memphis, Portland, Maine and Providence.
