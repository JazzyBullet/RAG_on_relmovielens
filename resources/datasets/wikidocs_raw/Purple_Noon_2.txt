== Critical reception ==
Purple Noon received generally positive reviews, with a normalized score of 63 out of 100 on review aggregation site Metacritic. In a positive review of the album, Alex Hudson of Canadian entertainment publisher Exclaim! wrote that on Purple Noon, Washed Out "flirts with the chillwave sounds he's known for without too blatantly repeating himself." Writing for Under the Radar magazine, Scott Elingburg felt that Washed Out "sounds more assured and more interested in stretching his abilities as a singer to accompany his electro pop soundscapes," but described some of the lyrical content as clichéd. Zach Schonfeld of Paste magazine was critical of the album's direction, writing that "there’s nothing here that complicates or advances Greene’s sound, nothing that particularly stands out from the agreeably monotonous haze."
