The Next Step is a Canadian teen drama series created by Frank Van Keeken, that originally premiered on Family Channel on March 8, 2013. Presented in a pseudo-documentary style influenced by reality television, the series follows the members of a troupe from the titular dance studio, as they train for and compete in various championships, while dealing with rivalries and drama from other dance schools and even among the team itself.
The Next Step has spawned digital content, live touring shows featuring its cast members, and a spinoff series titled Lost & Found Music Studios. The series has also been sold internationally to broadcasters such as CBBC in the United Kingdom, and Universal Kids in the United States—which became a production partner for its sixth season.
Beginning with its seventh season in 2020, the series moved to CBC Television's streaming platform, CBC Gem. An eighth season was announced in April 2022, with the series moving to YTV. In March 2023, CBBC commissioned a ninth season.
