Christian Aaron Boulogne (11 August 1962 – May 2023) also known as Ari Boulogne and Ari Päffgen was a French photographer, actor and writer.


== Early life ==
Boulogne was born in Neuilly-sur-Seine on 11 August 1962. He was the son of German singer and actress Nico. His biological father was French actor Alain Delon although Delon has consistently denied paternity to Boulogne. He was initially raised by his mother before he was adopted by Delon's mother Édith and her second husband Paul Boulogne whose surname he legally took. He spent most of his childhood in Bourg-la-Reine. In 2001 and 2019, Boulogne attempted to sue Delon for legal recognition of paternity but without success.


== Career ==
Boulogne reunited with his mother as a teenager and began his career as an actor. He made appearances in films directed by Philippe Garrel including The Inner Scar which he starred in with Nico and The Secret Son in which he was credited as Ari Päffgen. After acting, Boulogne took on a career as a photographer.


== Personal life and death ==
Boulogne had two children, a son Charles (born 1999), and a daughter Blanche (born 2006). In 2001, he published a memoir Love Never Forgets in which he elaborates on his relationship with his mother.
Boulogne was found dead in his Paris apartment on 20 May 2023, following a heroin overdose a month before. A woman, supposedly his partner, was taken into custody for failure of duty to rescue. He was 60, and was in an advanced stage of decomposition when discovered.
Shortly after his death was announced, his half-brother Anthony Delon paid tribute to him on Instagram, expressing his "great sadness".
