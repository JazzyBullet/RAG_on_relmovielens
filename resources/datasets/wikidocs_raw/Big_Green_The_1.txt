== Plot ==
Anna Montgomery (d'Abo), a teacher from Surrey, England, finds herself in the fictional town of Elma, Texas in the United States as part of an exchange program. Faced with the challenge of engaging her disheartened students, who view themselves as destined for failure, Anna introduces them to soccer in a novel attempt to connect. This introduction comes about when, in frustration, she inadvertently uses a broken globe to demonstrate soccer techniques. Seeing potential beyond their geography lesson, Anna decides to form a soccer team, enlisting the students as players and entering them into a league in Austin, Texas. Their initial excitement is tempered by the reality of competition, particularly after a crushing 18–0 defeat against the league's top team, the Knights.
Despite the setback, the team's fortunes begin to change with the arrival of Juan Morales (Esquivel), a talented new student. Convincing Juan's hesitant mother to allow him to join the team proves to be a turning point. With Juan on board, the team, now dubbed the Big Green, embarks on an extraordinary winning streak, culminating in an opportunity to face the Knights once again in the championship.
Parallel to the team's journey, the narrative delves into personal relationships and challenges. Tom Palmer (Guttenberg), the town's Sheriff's Deputy, steps in as co-coach, simultaneously developing a romantic interest in Anna. Meanwhile, the team's success brings unexpected conflict when Jay Huffer (Sanders), a former Elma resident and current Knights coach, learns of Juan's mother's undocumented status. This revelation, brought to light by Edwin Douglas (Terry), the father of Kate Douglas (Robertson), threatens to dismantle the team's unity and success.
The community is thrown into turmoil as Juan and his mother are forced to flee, fearing deportation. This situation tests the resolve of the players, especially Kate, who feels betrayed by both her father and Tom. However, Anna's leadership and persuasive skills keep the team focused on their goal, reinforcing their commitment to each other and the game.
As the championship day arrives, the Big Green faces the daunting task of competing without Juan, their star player, whose absence weighs heavily on the team. The match begins unfavorably for Elma, with the Knights taking a 2–0 lead by halftime. However, the game takes a dramatic turn when Juan, along with Tom and his mother, makes a surprising return. Tom announces he has secured a lawyer and sponsorship for Juan's mother, ensuring they can remain in the country legally. Buoyed by Juan's return and Tom's efforts, the team mounts a comeback, with Juan setting up a goal and scoring the equalizing goal himself, forcing the game into a penalty shootout.
In the shootout, each kick increases the pressure until Larry Musgrove (Renna), the Big Green's goalie, faces the ultimate test. Larry, who has been plagued by visions of opposing players as monsters, taps into his imagination to overcome his fears, successfully blocking a critical shot by imagining himself as a monster. This pivotal moment sets the stage for Newt Shaw (Hall), the youngest member of the Big Green, to take the final kick. Newt subsequently scores the winning goal, clinching the championship for the Big Green.
As part of a bet, Huffer, the Knights' coach and antagonist, begrudgingly honors his promise to kiss the Big Green's goat mascot, Ernie. The film closes with the unveiling of a new billboard in Elma that celebrates the Big Green's dual achievements on the soccer field and in academic improvement.
