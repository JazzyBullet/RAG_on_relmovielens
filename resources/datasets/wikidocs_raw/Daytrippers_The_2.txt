The Daytripper is a Texas travel program, hosted by Chet Garner as he travels the state with his crew. The Daytripper is a 15-time Lone Star Emmy Award winning travel show airing on PBS that highlights the culture, outdoors and food of a single tourist destination or area within each episode.
Synopsis: "It’s no secret that Texas is big. Alright, more than big. Texas is HUGE!! And exploring Texas ain’t no small vacation, it’s a lifetime endeavor. But what if you only have one day? Well that’s where we come in. From the well-known landmarks to the completely obscure dives and hideaways – and all within a day’s reach. We created The Daytripper to inspire folks to get out and explore their own backyard. Adventure is much closer than you realize. I’ll see you on the road."
The series first aired on Austin's PBS station, KLRU, and was titled "The Austin Daytripper." However, the concept expanded and the show condensed its name to "The Daytripper" to have a wider appeal. The show is now produced by Hogaboom Road, Inc., a production company located in downtown Georgetown, TX that specializes in creating Texas content.
The Daytripper has aired 13 seasons. Episodes are broadcast on PBS affiliate stations in Texas and many other states around the country. They are also available for viewing online.
