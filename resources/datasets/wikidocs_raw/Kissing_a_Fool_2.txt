"Kissing a Fool" is a song written and performed by English singer and songwriter George Michael, released by Columbia Records in 1988.
A ballad with minimal instrumentation and a jazz feel, the song was written about Michael's insecurities as a soulmate and partner because of the baggage and reputation with which he came. According to Michael, the vocals were recorded a cappella in one take. "Kissing a Fool" was the working title for the album, which later was renamed to Faith.
Aside from Michael's vocals, the song employs piano, guitar, bass, drums and a brass section. It was the seventh and final single to be released from the album Faith. It was also the least successful, making number 18 on the UK Singles Chart and becoming the first single in five not to make number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US. However, it reached number one on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks and became a number 5 hit on the Billboard Hot 100, being regarded critically as one of his most vulnerable recordings and one of his best ballads. In 2021, BBC Radio 2 listeners voted "Kissing a Fool" as number 15 in their top 40 George Michael songs.
"Kissing a Fool" was Michael's last single for almost two years in the United Kingdom. It was later covered by Michael Bublé on his self-titled album and released as a single in the United States and reached No. 29 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart.


== Writing ==
According to an interview published in the December 1987 issue of International Musician and Recording World magazine, Michael remembers writing "Kissing a Fool" en route to Japan for Wham!'s 1984 tour (referring to the Big Tour) in early 1985. However, much like other songs Michael was writing at the time, it couldn't be used for Wham! due to certain restrictions in the duo's image; a solo album would be the best chance to use it (which, in that case, turned out to be the Faith album more than two years later).
Michael elaborated on the writing of "Kissing a Fool":

I don't think I've ever been influenced by other friends as to who I should or shouldn't go out with. "Kissing a Fool" isn't really about that. It's about a relationship I had with someone who couldn't handle the situation because of who I was, George Michael. At the time it did surprise me. First I hadn't realized how much I'd achieved and secondly I hadn't realized it could have its limitations. I write it in that swing style because I think that period of music had that feeling of resignation. It's very much a late night giving up feeling.
