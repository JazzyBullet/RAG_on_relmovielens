"Licence to Kill" is a song by American singer Gladys Knight, written and recorded for the James Bond film Licence to Kill, taken from the soundtrack of the film's same name. The song was written by Narada Michael Walden, Jeffrey Cohen and Walter Afanasieff, and produced by Walden and associate production helmed by Afanasieff.
"Licence to Kill" was released as the soundtrack's lead single on May 30, 1989, by MCA Records. The song became a top-10 hit in the United Kingdom, peaking at number six and becoming Knight's last charting solo single there. In Europe, the song peaked atop the Swedish Singles Chart for eight weeks (four chart periods at the time) and reached the top five in seven other European countries. It also peaked at number 79 on Canada's RPM 100 Singles chart but did not appear on the US Billboard Hot 100.


== Critical reception ==
Jerry Smith from Music Week wrote, "Gladys Knight beats all-comers for the dubious pleasure of singing the theme to the latest Bond movie, written and produced by Narada Michael Walden, and basically a pastiche of the best of the previous themes. It can't really fail." Pat Sharp for Smash Hits felt "Licence to Kill" "sounds very dramatic and James Bond-y".
