== Plot ==
In the story, a wrecking ball demolishes an abandoned building, causing a magic lamp inside to fall onto a boombox. The genie inside, named Kazaam, decides to reside in the boombox. Meanwhile, a 14-year-old boy named Max Conner goes to school and faces various challenges. He deals with bullies who retaliate against him for a failed robbery attempt. Max seeks refuge in the abandoned building and accidentally releases Kazaam from the boombox. Kazaam becomes Max's genie and demonstrates his powers before disappearing.
Max notices his father during his journey home and discovers that his mother plans to marry a fireman named Travis O'Neil. Max resents Travis and confronts his mother about hiding the truth about his real father's whereabouts. Determined to find his father, Max encounters Kazaam again, who pesters him into making a wish. Max eventually reunites with his father, Nick Matteo, a musical talent agent involved in unauthorized music. Although Max initially does not care about his father's profession, he is happy to see him and is introduced to the employees of Nick's agency.
Max shares the news with Kazaam and they have a bike race in Max's hideout, where Kazaam showcases his powers. Kazaam persuades Max to make his first wish, causing junk food to rain from the sky. Max realizes that he has control over Kazaam until he uses his last two wishes. They visit Max's father again and attend a show where Kazaam's genie abilities impress Malik, the nightclub owner who desires to control Kazaam.
Kazaam stays at Max's home, pretending to be his tutor. Max confides in Kazaam about his strained relationship with his father, and Kazaam shares a rap about his own genie origins. Max tries to wish for his parents to rekindle their love, but Kazaam cannot grant this wish since he is not a djinn.
Later, Max witnesses his father being attacked by Malik and his hitmen over a stolen master tape, which Max was pressured into by his bullies.  Max seeks help from Kazaam, who hesitates due to his newfound success as a rapper. Max uses his second wish to conjure a replacement tape, causing a rift between him and Kazaam. Max's father confronts him about the stolen tape, leading to their separation.
That night, Max is kidnapped by Malik, who takes control of Kazaam's boombox. Max's father is also held captive. Malik forces Kazaam to do his bidding, but Kazaam breaks free and defeats Malik and his minions. Kazaam transforms Malik into a basketball and dunks him into a garbage disposal. However, Kazaam discovers Max's lifeless body and regrets not being able to grant Max's wish for a second chance with his father.
In his grief, Kazaam becomes a djinn, granting him the power to bring Max's father back to life. Kazaam saves Max and carries him out of the burning building, where Travis rescues them. Max's father expresses his desire to rebuild their relationship before leaving with the authorities. Kazaam, now a djinn, walks away, facing the lighthearted annoyance of his new girlfriend, who pressures him into getting a job, while unaware of the concept of a job. Max watches Kazaam walk away with a smile.
