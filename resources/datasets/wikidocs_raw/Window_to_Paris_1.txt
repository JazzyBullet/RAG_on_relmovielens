In the film, which is set in the 1990s, a magical portal connecting Saint Petersburg with Paris is discovered. The main character, Nikolai Chizhov, is a school music teacher and a member of the Russian intelligentsia.


== Reception ==
Mamin considered it unfair that the film was not chosen as the official Russian submission for the 1994 Academy Award for Best International Feature Film, asserting that this was due to the personal and political influence of Nikita Mikhalkov.
