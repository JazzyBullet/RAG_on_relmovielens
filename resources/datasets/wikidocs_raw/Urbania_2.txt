Urbino is the ancient Urbinum Mataurense, a Roman municipium. Urbino was held by the Ostrogoths from the late 5th century, but was captured by Belisarius (538). Under Pepin the Short it became part of the pontifical domain.
Circa 590 it was established as Diocese of Urbino, on reassigned territory from the suppressed Diocese of Sant'Angelo in Vado. 

On 8 March 1401, it lost territory to establish the Abbacy nullius of San Cristoforo di Castel Durante
On 7 July 1563, it was promoted as Metropolitan Archdiocese of Urbino by Pope Pius IV, initially with six suffragan sees: Diocese of Cagli, Diocese of Sinigaglia, Diocese of Pesaro, diocese of Fossombrone, Diocese of Montefeltro and Diocese of Gubbio; later were added : diocese of S. Angelo in Vado and Diocese of Pergola.
On 20 October 1636, it lost territory to its suffragan Diocese of Sant'Angelo in Vado
On 30 September 1986, it was renamed as Archdiocese of Urbino–Urbania–Sant’Angelo in Vado/Urbinaten(sis)–Urbanien(sis)–Sancti Angeli in Vado (Latin), having gained territory from the suppressed Diocese of Urbania and Sant'Angelo in Vado, whose titles its adopted, turning its cathedral into co-cathedrals.
