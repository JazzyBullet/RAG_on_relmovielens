== Synopsis ==
After inheriting a fortune from his late mother's small family home, a humble office worker surprises his colleagues with a lavish mansion. As they gather for a party, fueled by alcohol and freed from workplace constraints, their diverse emotions lead to awkward and sometimes chaotic behavior. What begins as a lighthearted celebration soon escalates into conflicts, including a showdown between the morality-minded boss and a libertine employee sparked by a risqué striptease.
