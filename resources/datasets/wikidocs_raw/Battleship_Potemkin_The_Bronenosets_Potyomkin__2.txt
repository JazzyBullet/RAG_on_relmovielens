Eric Allaman is an American composer who has worked in film, television, theater and ballet.  His career began when he co-composed the score to Ridley Scott's Legend with the German electronic group Tangerine Dream. That opportunity led to Eric re-scoring the silent classic, Battleship Potemkin which was re-released in Europe and featured at the Berlin Film Festival.


== Life and career ==
Born in Springfield, Missouri, Allaman's family moved around the Midwest and eventually settled in Dana Point, California. Allaman began studying the piano at age 7, the guitar at age 16, and continued his studies at UCLA with an emphasis on music and theater.
Shortly after graduating, Allaman moved to Paris, France and ultimately West Berlin, Germany to further his musical career. Allaman hooked up with Reinhard Scheuregger and the two became Berlin Game.  The duo scored four films, Legend (1985 film), Battleship Potemkin, Down Twisted, Angel III: The Final Chapter, and released one album, Berlin Game.  After the success of Legend and Battleship Potemkin, Berlin Game (Allaman & Scheuregger) returned to Los Angeles to field film scoring offers. After the WGA strike in 1988, Allaman and Scheuregger separated ways and Allaman began working under his own name.  He has scored 43 movies and over 600 episodes of television shows and is best known for his scores to Legend, Battleship Potemkin, Latter Days, Witless Protection, Mike Hammer Private Eye, Extreme Makeover: Home Edition and Dante's Cove.
