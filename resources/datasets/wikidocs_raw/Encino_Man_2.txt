Encino (Spanish for "oak") is a neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles, California.


== Etymology ==
The name Encino is the Spanish language word for "oak." The Spanish name reflects the original Tongva language name for the village of Siutcanga, which can be translated to "the place of the oaks."


== History ==

In 1769, the Spanish Portolá expedition, first Europeans to see inland areas of California, traveled north through Sepulveda Pass into the San Fernando Valley on August 5 and stayed two nights at the Tongva village of Siutcanga ("the place of the oaks") near what is now Los Encinos State Historic Park. Fray Juan Crespi, a Franciscan missionary traveling with the expedition, named the valley "El Valle de Santa Catalina de Bolonia de Los Encinos" (The Valley of St. Catherine of Bologna of the Oaks). All of Crespi's name was later dropped except "Encino".
Rancho Los Encinos (Ranch of Holm Oaks) was established in 1845 when a large parcel of former Mission San Fernando land was granted to three Mission Indians by governor Pio Pico. Many ranchos were created after the secularization of the California missions, which began in 1834. Encino derives its name from the rancho.
