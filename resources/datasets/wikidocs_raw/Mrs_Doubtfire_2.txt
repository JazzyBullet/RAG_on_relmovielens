Mrs. Doubtfire is a musical based on the 1993 film Mrs. Doubtfire, which in turn is based on the 1987 novel Alias Madame Doubtfire by Anne Fine, with music and lyrics by Karey and Wayne Kirkpatrick and a book by Karey Kirkpatrick and John O'Farrell. The musical is set in the city of San Francisco, California.


== Background ==
A musical adaptation of Mrs. Doubtfire was in the works in 2015, with music by Alan Menken, lyrics by David Zippel, and a book by Harvey Fierstein (who played Frank Hillard in the movie). Producer Kevin McCollum had previously spoken to The New York Times in 2013 about the 1993 movie's musical prospects, noting that the plot was "tailored for Broadway audiences". However, three years later, Menken told that the project was put on 'creative hiatus', citing changes in the creative team as the problem. Nevertheless, in 2018, McCollum revealed that the adaptation was still aiming for a Broadway bow, but with an entirely different creative team which includes Karey and Wayne Kirkpatrick composing the score, and John O'Farrell and Karey Kirkpatrick writing the book. Tony Award-winner Jerry Zaks became the director of the show.
On May 16 and 17, 2019, the musical held a reading with a cast including Rob McClure, Kate Baldwin, Mario Cantone, and Jake Ryan Flynn.
