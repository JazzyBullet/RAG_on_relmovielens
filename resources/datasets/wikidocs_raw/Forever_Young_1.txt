"Forever Young" is a song by German synth-pop band Alphaville from their 1984 debut studio album of the same name. The single was successful in Scandinavia and in the European German-speaking countries in the same year.
The single achieved more success in the United States than in the United Kingdom, but it failed to reach the American top 40 despite three separate US single releases. Though not the group's highest-charting single in Europe, "Forever Young" was one of the band's signature songs and has been covered by numerous artists. It also formed the basis of Jay-Z's song "Young Forever". "Forever Young" is written in the key of C major.
In a 2022 interview, Marian Gold said that it's "a great privilege" to have "Forever Young", as well as "Big in Japan", in "their luggage" when touring, and that he is grateful to be able to perform these songs.

==== Background and video ====
Intended to be an upbeat dance song, producer Andreas Budde recommended paring the song down to a sparse synth-pop ballad.: 48:37  
Marian Gold originally wrote the third verse to evoke a "fascistic feeling" of the adoration of the crowd:: 51:28 

Can you imagine how we won the war?
Little fascist lady she loves you so
Following her leader, she's getting in tune
The music's played by the madmen

However, for the final recording, record executives pushed for a change, resulting in:: 51:49 

Can you imagine when this race is won
Turn our golden faces into the sun
Praising our leaders we're getting in tune
The music's played by the madmen

Gold calls the replacement "turn our golden faces into the sun" the worst lyric in the song.: 52:01  
Not a native English speaker, Gold received pronunciation instruction from producer Colin Pearson.: 52:55   The band had decided that the word "dance" in the first line should be pronounced /dɑːns/ in order for the song to sound British, but Gold would forget and sing the American pronunciation /dæns/.: 54:20 
Originally released by Alphaville as a single in 1984, "Forever Young" was available in both its original mix and in a dance version, entitled the "Special Dance Mix". Over the years, the band has released several remixes and demo versions of the song.
In the US, the song debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 95 in the week of 23 March 1985, peaking at number 93 the following week, before dropping off the chart following a four-week run; it also peaked at number 32 on the Hot Dance/Disco Club Play chart on 30 March. When re-released in 1988, the song was more successful in the US, peaking at number 65 on the Billboard Hot 100 in a total run of 14 weeks.
The song's music video, directed by Brian Ward, shows the band performing in one of the halls at Holloway Sanatorium in Virginia Water, England. A number of people from children to the elderly, dressed in ragged finery, awake to watch the band, then walk through a diamond-shaped glowing portal.
