"Boogie Nights" is a 1977 single by international funk-disco group Heatwave. It was written by keyboardist Rod Temperton and was included on Heatwave's debut album, Too Hot to Handle. Harpist Carla Skanger (a pseudonym of Sheila Bromberg of the London Symphony Orchestra) played harp and American actor and singer Clarke Peters performed backing vocals on the recording.


== History ==
The song became one of the best-known disco songs by a British group and charted at No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart. In the US, "Boogie Nights" also peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 behind "You Light Up My Life" by Debby Boone.  It  appeared on US Billboard R&B and dance charts during 1977. "Boogie Nights" reached No. 1 in New Zealand. The single was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).
In the United Kingdom, the song was No. 2, and entered on March 5, 1977, only behind Leo Sayer with "When I Need You".
"Boogie Nights" has been covered many times by artists such as KC and the Sunshine Band, Will to Power, 911 and The Weather Girls. British boy-band Blue also performed the tune in their live shows.
The song made an appearance in the films Eyes of Laura Mars, Summer of Sam and The Stud, though it was not featured in the 1997 film titled after it: Boogie Nights. Apparently the group's lead singer, Johnnie Wilder Jr., a devout born-again Christian, refused to allow the use of the recording in the film because the song was about dancing, not pornography, while the film was about the latter.
Aaron Judge, right-fielder for the New York Yankees, famously uses the song as his walk-up.
