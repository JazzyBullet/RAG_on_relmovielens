== Reception ==
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Wirey Spindell holds an approval rating of 24%, based on 17 reviews.
Variety wrote that it is the "mix of sex and Schaeffer’s decidedly quirky view of life that sells the pic", and that the scenes where Mabius portrayes Wirey are "among the best in the film."
Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote that Schaeffer is "discreet and funny" and "inspires his actors to risk everything, as he does on both sides of the camera", with Morgenthau being "as venturesome as Schaeffer himself", and Kravat's score being "equally potent". He concluded that while the film "may be too heady for some tastes", it "can stir you deeply, if you’re open to it."
A. O. Scott of The New York Times called the film "banal, boring and confusing."
Marjorie Baumgarten of The Austin Chronicle wrote that Schaeffer "needs to realize that there are few universals in his stories and way too many specifics, and it takes more than a weird name like Wirey Spindell to make a person really distinctive."
