== Feature live-action films ==
The launch of the mobile game Pokémon Go in 2016 reignited mainstream interest back into the Pokémon franchise in the Western market since its initial peak in the early 2000s; various Hollywood film companies approached The Pokémon Company to gain film rights. Eventually, Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Entertainment struck a deal to produce a live-action adaptation of the 2016 video game Detective Pikachu called Pokémon Detective Pikachu, the first official live-action Pokémon film. In January 2019, ahead of film's release, Legendary has begun development on a sequel to Pokémon Detective Pikachu.


== Television films ==
These television films, which run longer than the normal half-hour and are not usually separated into more than one episode in either the original or the dub, are often considered TV Pokémon movies, not counting towards the running total. They never appear in theaters, but are instead broadcast on the same networks that the regular anime is broadcast for their premieres. Though they may air around the same time as other episodes of the anime, usually in the anime's normal timeslot, they are not assigned episode numbers.


== Short films ==
Pikachu shorts are anime short films that are commonly shown at the start of animated theatrical films based on Pokémon, but have also been expanded to fulfill other purposes. There are 27 Pikachu short movies.
