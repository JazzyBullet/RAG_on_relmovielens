Lotto Land is a 1995 American drama film starring Lawrence Gilliard Jr. and Wendell Holmes.


== Plot ==
The picture combines the storylines of two single-parent households in a poor, racially-diverse part of Brooklyn. One story concerns a young black man, who would like to remove himself from his drug-using friends. The young man falls in love with a Latina girl, who is intending to go to university on a full scholarship. The second story entwines the lives of those characters' parents: the mother of one character works in the local liquor store; the father of the other works for the telephone company. The narrative unfolds as a winning lottery ticket worth twenty-seven million dollars is sold to a local customer at the liquor store.
