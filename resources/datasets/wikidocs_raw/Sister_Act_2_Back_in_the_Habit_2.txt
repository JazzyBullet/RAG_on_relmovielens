=== Sister Act (1992) ===

When a lively lounge singer Deloris Van Cartier (Whoopi Goldberg) sees her mobster beau, Vince LaRocca (Harvey Keitel), commit murder, she is relocated for her protection. Set up in the guise of a nun in a California convent, Deloris proceeds to upend the quiet lives of the resident sisters. In an effort to keep her out of trouble, they assign Deloris to the convent's choir, an ensemble that she soon turns into a vibrant and soulful act that gains widespread attention.


=== Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit (1993) ===

In the sequel, Las Vegas performer Deloris Van Cartier (Whoopi Goldberg) is surprised by a visit from her nun friends, including Sister Mary Patrick (Kathy Najimy) and Sister Mary Lazarus (Mary Wickes). She soon finds out that she is needed in her nun guise as Sister Mary Clarence to help teach music to teens at a troubled school in hopes of keeping the facility from closing at the hands of Mr. Crisp (James Coburn), a callous administrator.

=== Possible remake (TBA) ===
On June 3, 2015, a remake was confirmed to be in the works with Legally Blonde screenwriters Kirsten Smith and Karen McCullah writing.


=== Sister Act 3: Kicking the Habit (TBA) ===
When asked in a 2013 appearance on Watch What Happens Live about acting in a sequel, Whoopi Goldberg initially refused, citing the passing of so many of her nun co-stars, stating "it's not Sister Act without them." But during a 2015 appearance on Watch What Happens Live, she changed her stance to a maybe, stating:

I generally say no to that, because so many of the nuns have passed and it just wouldn't feel right for me. I'm kind of old for it now. That's not to say I wouldn't do it, but it feels like there's a new generation for Sister Act and so maybe I can be a nun now.After a Broad City cameo in 2016, Goldberg expressed doubts about a sequel based on missing cast members, but said she thought it would be fun and likable. In May 2017, she affirmed her desire for the third film to happen, adding in July that she would like to direct it and had confidence it would be made. On December 7, 2018, it was confirmed that Regina Y. Hicks and Karin Gist were hired to write the script to Sister Act 3 with it being planned for a release on Disney+. Goldberg confirmed again on October 7, 2020, during an appearance on The Late Late Show with James Corden that she is working on the sequel and wants to bring as many of the original cast back for it as possible.
In December 2020, it was revealed that Goldberg had officially signed on to return as Delores and that Tyler Perry would be producing and directing the film.


=== Reworked musical ===
A reworked version of the musical is expected to debut at the Curve, Leicester starring Brenda Edwards and produced by Whoopi Goldberg and Jamie Wilson.
