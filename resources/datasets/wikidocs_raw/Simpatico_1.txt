When an official uncovers the scam, they set him up for blackmail. Twenty years later, Carter and Rosie are married, successful racers in Kentucky about to sell their prize stallion, Simpatico. Vinnie, meanwhile, is a drunk in Pomona. Vinnie decides to make a play for Rosie, lures Carter to California, steals his wallet and heads for Kentucky with the original blackmail material.
