In 1982, Love and Pamplin were fined $750 and placed on six months' probation for a home invasion and assault on Dennis Wilson In 1990, Love filed a petition to be appointed as Brian Wilson's conservator, partly resulting in the court-ordered severing of personal and financial ties between Wilson and his therapist Eugene Landy in 1991.
