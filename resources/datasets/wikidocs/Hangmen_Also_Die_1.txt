Hangmen Also Die! is a 1943 war film directed by the Austrian director Fritz Lang and written by John Wexley from a story by Bertolt Brecht (credited as Bert Brecht) and Lang. The film stars Brian Donlevy, with Walter Brennan, Anna Lee, and Gene Lockhart, and Dennis O'Keefe in support. Alexander Granach has a showy role as a Gestapo detective, and Hans Heinrich von Twardowski has a cameo as Reinhard Heydrich.  Hanns Eisler composed the Academy Award nominated score, and James Wong Howe was cinematographer.
The film is loosely based on the 1942 assassination of Heydrich, the Nazi Reich Protector of German-occupied Prague during World War II.  The number-two man in the SS, and a chief mastermind of the Holocaust, Heydrich earned the epithet of "The Hangman of Europe."  Though the real Heydrich was assassinated by Czech resistance fighters parachuted from a British plane in Operation Anthropoid, this was not known at the time of filming.  Instead, Heydrich's killer is depicted as a member of the Czech resistance with ties to the Communist Party.
