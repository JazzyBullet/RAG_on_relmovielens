=== Original series ===


==== The Fly (1958) ====

The screenplay of the first film is based on a short story of the same name written by George Langelaan in 1957, presenting a scientist, André Delambre (David Hedison), who accidentally mixes his molecules with a fly in an experiment of his new invention, a matter transference device, and therefore transforms into a human-fly hybrid monster, leading to a series of inevitable tragedies.


==== Return of the Fly (1959) ====

Years after the first film, Phillipe Delambre (Brett Halsey), the son of the scientist who turned in to human-fly hybrid, has become an adult and decides to complete the work of his deceased father: the experiment on the matter transporter. He hires Alan Hines (David Frankham), who then turns out to be an industrial spy by the name of Ronald Holms, to help with the experiment. As the experiment going on the right track, Ronald's true intention begins to be uncovered.


==== Curse of the Fly (1965) ====

Martin Delambre (George Baker) encounters a beautiful young girl, Patricia Stanley (Carole Gray), one night on his way to Montreal. The loving couple soon get married, but they are both keeping horrible secrets to each other: Patricia was actually escaping from an asylum the night they met; and Martin is secretly experimenting on a teleportation project which has already made considerable victims with his father, Henri Delambre (Brian Donlevy). With Patricia being traced down, secrets of the couple are facing the risk of getting revealed.

==== The Fly (1986) ====

Scientist Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum), has successfully invented a teleportation device which can disintegrate matter in one "Telepod" and reintegrate it in another. Journalist Veronica "Ronnie" (Geena Davis) agrees to document Seth's project, and the two become lovers. One night, Seth rashly decides to test the process on himself, but fails to notice a common housefly which has slipped into the transmitter pod with him. The computer becomes confused by the fly's presence, and merges it with Seth at the genetic level. Unaware of the accident, Seth initially believes that his newly-increased strength and energy are a result of the teleportation process purifying and improving his body, but his behavior soon becomes arrogant and violent. Veronica notices the disturbing changes in Seth's personality, whose body begins a prolonged and grotesque process of deteriorating into a human-insect hybrid creature, which Seth dubs "Brundlefly". Ronnie and the diseased Seth must both cope with the effects of his transformation on their relationship, while Seth desperately searches for a cure before his humanity—and his sanity—completely drain away.


==== The Fly II (1989) ====

The sequel continues the story, with Veronica Quaife dying in the process of giving birth to Seth Brundle's mutant son. The child, named Martin Brundle (Eric Stoltz), is adopted by Anton Bartok (Lee Richardson), the head of Bartok Industries and sponsor of Seth's experiment. Martin's unique heritage (which he is kept unaware of) results in his suffering from rapid aging, but also provides him with a photographic memory and no need for sleep. Physically a grown adult by his fifth birthday, Martin is given t
