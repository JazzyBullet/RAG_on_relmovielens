Sorority House Massacre II (also known as Sorority House Massacre II: Nighty Nightmare) is a 1990 American slasher film directed by Jim Wynorski, featuring scream queens Melissa Ann Moore and Gail Harris (credited as Robyn Harris). It follows five sorority sisters who are stalked and murdered by an unknown assailant after purchasing a large house. Much like its predecessors, Sorority House Massacre II has received a cult following over the years.
It is a loose sequel to Sorority House Massacre, as well as Slumber Party Massacre, from which it recycles some footage. It was followed by Sorority House Massacre III: Hard to Die, which was a remake based on the same script as the second film.
