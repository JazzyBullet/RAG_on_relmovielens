== Music ==
The film's score was composed by Carlo Crivelli. Its soundtrack included songs by J J Cale, Beth Hirsch's "I Could Love You Too", and "Oba, La Vem Ela" by Jorge Ben.


== Reception ==

Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 1 out of 4. Ebert was critical of the leading lady "Giocante has been billed as "the new Bardot," and she's off to a good start: Bardot didn't make many good films, either." Ebert was unimpressed by the "recycling exhausted cliches" and found the non-sequential storytelling exhausting, but gave some praise for the scenery, compositions, and "pretty pictures". He concludes "Giocante and Malgras are superficially attractive, although because their characters are empty vessels there's no reason to like them much, or care about them. The movie is cast as a tragedy, and it's tragic, all right: tragic that these kids never developed intelligence and personalities."


=== Accolades ===
The film was in competition for the Tiger Award at the 1998 International Film Festival Rotterdam (IFFR).
