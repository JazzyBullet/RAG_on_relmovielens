Child's Play is an American horror franchise that consists of eight slasher films, a television series, and numerous comic books. The main antagonist is Chucky (except in the fourth and fifth films). Chucky is the embodiment of Charles Lee Ray, the notorious Lakeshore Strangler whose soul passed onto a Good Guy Doll. Chucky pursues a variation of victims in each installment, usually to possess a new human host. Recurring characters in the series include Chucky's first target and Child's Play trilogy protagonist Andy Barclay, and Chucky's wife/partner Tiffany Valentine. The 2019 remake starring Aubrey Plaza has similar themes but is not connected to the original franchise. The 2021 television series is a continuation of the original franchise and sees the return of several characters, including Andy Barclay, while also introducing several new characters.
