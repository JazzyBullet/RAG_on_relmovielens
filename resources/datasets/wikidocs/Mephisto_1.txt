Mephisto is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character first appeared in Silver Surfer #3 (December 1968), and was created by Stan Lee and John Buscema and based on Mephistopheles: a demon character from the Faust legend, who has sometimes been referred to as Mephisto. Introduced as a recurring adversary of the Silver Surfer and Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze), Mephisto has also endured as one of Spider-Man's most prominent adversaries, being responsible for Norman and Harry Osborn's respective transformations into the Green Goblin and Kindred; and for the superhero's loss of his marriage to Mary Jane Watson, considering their future daughter Spider-Girl his archenemy. Mephisto has often come into conflict with Doctor Strange, Doctor Doom, Scarlet Witch and other heroes of the Marvel Universe, being responsible both for the creation of the Cosmic Ghost Rider and the descents of Phil Coulson and Otto Octavius into villainy.
Debuting in the Silver Age of comic books, the character has appeared in over five decades of Marvel continuity. The character has also appeared in associated Marvel merchandise, including animated television series, feature film, toys, trading cards, and video games.
Mephisto has been described as one of Marvel's most notable and powerful supervillains.
Peter Fonda portrayed the character in the 2007 film Ghost Rider, and Ciaran Hinds portrayed him in its 2012 sequel Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance.


== Publication history ==
Inspired by Mephistopheles of the Faust legend, he was introduced into Marvel comics by writer Stan Lee and penciler John Buscema, Mephisto debuted in Silver Surfer #3 (cover dated Dec. 1968), and was established as a perennial foe for the cosmic hero, also appearing in Silver Surfer #8–9 (Sept.–Oct. 1969) and 16–17 (May–June 1970).
Author Mike Conroy has described Mephisto as "the tempter who could offer the endlessly soul-tormented Silver Surfer the world, even dangling the Surfer's off-limits long-distance lover in front of him. As always the case with Lee's heroes, the Surfer's goodness and nobility won out, but Mephisto was only stymied, not defeated, and the pattern was set."
Mephisto went on to become a foe for the Norse god Thor in Thor #180–181 (Sept.–Oct. 1970), Astonishing Tales #8 (Oct. 1971) and Thor #204–205 (Oct.–Nov. 1972). He was later revealed to be the being to whom Johnny Blaze had sold his soul to and thus had been cursed to become the Ghost Rider, in a retcon that placed him in the role originally played by Satan. This was later retconned back to Satan, though Mephisto's influence is still felt in the 1990s by the Danny Ketch Ghost Rider.
Other appearances included posing as Satan in Marvel Spotlight #5 (Aug. 1972); tormenting the titular superhero team in Fantastic Four #155–157 (Feb.–April 1975) and Thor #310 (Aug. 1981) and 325 (Nov. 1982). Mephisto also guest-starred in two miniseries: The Vision and the Scarlet Witch (vol. 2) #1–12 (Oct. 1985–Sept. 1986) and Secret Wars II #1-9 (July 1985 – March 1986), before starring in the self-titled miniseries Mephisto vs. #1–4 (April–July 1987), battling four of Marvel's super-teams. The miniseries was penciled by co-creator Buscema.
In Daredevil #266 (May 1989), penciler John Romita, Jr. redesigned the character, reimagining him as a bloated, naked creature with short, vaguely frog-like legs and a demonic-looking head. Romita explained "I couldn't see the Devil with tights and a cape." Subsequent portrayals have varied between Mephisto's original appearance and the Romita redesign.
Mephisto continued to torment the Scarlet Witch in Avengers West Coast #51–52 (Nov.–Dec. 1989); created a new adversary for the Marvel heroes in Daredevil #270 (Sept. 1989); and appeared in Marvel Graphic Novel No. 49 Doctor Strange and Doctor Doom: Triumph and Torment (1989). Additionally, he was featured prominently in the One More Day story line in The Amazing Spider-Man #544; Friendly N
