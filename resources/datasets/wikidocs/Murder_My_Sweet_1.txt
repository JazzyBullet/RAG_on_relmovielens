Murder, My Sweet (released as Farewell, My Lovely in the United Kingdom) is a 1944 American film noir, directed by Edward Dmytryk and starring Dick Powell, Claire Trevor and Anne Shirley (in her final film before retirement).  The film is based on Raymond Chandler's 1940 novel Farewell, My Lovely.  It was the first film to feature Chandler's primary character, the hard-boiled private detective Philip Marlowe.
Murder, My Sweet is, along with Double Indemnity (released five months prior), one of the first films noirs, and a key influence in the development of the genre.
