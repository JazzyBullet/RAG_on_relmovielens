== History ==


=== 1999–2001: early years ===

In 1993, lead vocalist Pierre Bouvier and drummer Chuck Comeau were in a band named Reset. In 1998, Comeau left the group to go to college. In mid 1999, he met with high school friends and guitarists Jeff Stinco and Sébastien Lefebvre who were in separate bands of their own. Comeau, Stinco, and Lefebvre formed a new band together, called Simple Plan. In late 1999, Bouvier and Comeau reacquainted at a Sugar Ray concert and Bouvier left Reset soon after to join Comeau in the band. Bassist and backing vocalist David Desrosiers replaced Bouvier in Reset, but he too left the band six months later to join Simple Plan. This allowed Bouvier, who had doubled as the band's lead vocalist and bassist, to concentrate on  singing, and Stinco, who had doubled as the band's lead guitarist and backing vocalist, to concentrate on guitar. In 2001 the band performed at Edgefest II in Toronto.
Originally, the band did not have the name. At first, they considered naming the band Touchdown 999; later Bouvier's friends chose the name Simple Plan, derived from the 1998 film of the same name.


=== 2002–2006: No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls and Still Not Getting Any... ===

In 2002, Simple Plan released their debut studio album, No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls, which featured the singles "I'm Just a Kid", "I'd Do Anything", "Addicted", and "Perfect". The band was aiming for a pure pop-punk record. The record was originally released in the United States with 12 tracks, ending with "Perfect". Enhanced and foreign editions came in several different versions with up to two additional tracks in addition to the original 12. Two pop punk singers contributed on vocals: Mark Hoppus from Blink-182 on "I'd Do Anything" and included vocals by Joel Madden from Good Charlotte on "You Don't Mean Anything." The years of 2002 and 2003 were formative for the band. MTV Networks featured "Addicted" on one of their top performing shows during the spring of 2003 in the United States and internationally; on MTV and MTVu, and was filmed at the University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo) in Western New York. Addicted was the theme song for Fraternity Life. While the show was taken off the air the following season the band continued to rise on the billboard charts in the United States and performances continued to be booked and reruns of the show played around the world.
In 2002, the band also performed and recorded the theme song for a rebooted installment of the Scooby-Doo franchise, What's New, Scooby-Doo?. This show
