Lisa and the Devil is a 1974 horror film directed by Mario Bava. The film was first released in Spain as El diablo se lleva a los muertos (lit. 'The Devil Takes the Dead') and stars Elke Sommer as a young tourist named Lisa who loses her way in Toledo and spends the night at a villa belonging to a mysterious countess and her son.
Producer Alfred Leone later sought to exploit the popularity of The Exorcist by using scenes from Lisa and the Devil alongside newly-filmed scenes (co-directed with Lamberto Bava) in a cut entitled The House of Exorcism, which features a priest attempting to exorcise a possessed Lisa. Mario Bava permitted the new cut but only claimed ownership of Lisa and the Devil.: 89
