Lisa and the Devil is a 1974 horror film directed by Mario Bava. The film was first released in Spain as El diablo se lleva a los muertos (lit. 'The Devil Takes the Dead') and stars Elke Sommer as a young tourist named Lisa who loses her way in Toledo and spends the night at a villa belonging to a mysterious countess and her son.
Producer Alfred Leone later sought to exploit the popularity of The Exorcist by using scenes from Lisa and the Devil alongside newly-filmed scenes (co-directed with Lamberto Bava) in a cut entitled The House of Exorcism, which features a priest attempting to exorcise a possessed Lisa. Mario Bava permitted the new cut but only claimed ownership of Lisa and the Devil.: 89 


== Plot ==
During a tour of Toledo, Lisa Reiner encounters a fresco that depicts the Devil carrying off the dead. Hearing music, Lisa wanders into a shop, where she finds a music box topped with rotating figurines. The shop owner, who is helping a man named Leandro design a mustachioed dummy, informs Lisa that the box belongs to Leandro, who resembles the Devil in the fresco.
Lisa flees and becomes lost in the city. She eventually re-encounters Leandro, who points her through a nearby arch. After walking through the arch and climbing a stone stairway, Lisa is confronted by Carlos, who resembles Leandro’s mustachioed dummy. He refers to Lisa as "Elena" and claims that he has come back for her. A distressed Lisa pushes him away, inadvertently causing him to fall down the stairway to his apparent death. She flees the scene and cries for help.
As night falls, Lisa hitchhikes with a married couple, Francis and Sophia Lehar, and their chauffeur George. The car breaks down, and the group seek refuge at a nearby villa, where Leandro serves as the butler to a blind old countess and her son, Maximilian, who convinces his overprotective mother to allow the group to spend the night at a cottage on the property while George repairs the car.
Sophia and George have sex while Francis bathes. Lisa flees the cottage after seeing Carlos try to enter through a bathroom window, and then sees him pursuing her across the property. She runs into Maximilian, who claims that she merely saw Leandro carrying the Carlos dummy. He alludes to a romantic history between Lisa and him, despite Lisa’s insistence that she does not know him and had never visited the villa.
Later, Lisa and the Lehars dine with Maximilian and the countess, who suggests that there is a fifth guest at the villa. Maximilian excuses himself to deliver dessert to an unseen detained person in an upstairs bedroom. He tells the detainee that Carlos has returned and vows to never again let him come between them. He burns a photograph of Elena, who strongly resembles Lisa. 
Lisa has a vision of Elena in a tryst with Carlos, and then of herself kissing Maximilian, who morphs into Carlos. Outside, Francis insults and slaps Sophia for her extramarital affair, and she discovers the body of George, who has been stabbed to death and left in the repaired car. Maximilian and Leandro advise Francis to leave George’s corpse and depart the premises without involving the police.
While walking the grounds together, Maximilian vows to Lisa that he will never leave her, but the countess suddenly interrupts them to chastise her son for his doomed romance. Lisa wanders away from them and again encounters Carlos, who tells her to wait for him while he spies on Leandro. Lisa herself witnesses Leandro going into the estate's chapel and arranging what appears to be Carlos’s body in a coffin, but then she immediately runs into Carlos outside the chapel again. She flees into the villa and discovers a bedroom full of dummies, but faints when Carlos suddenly reappears.
Meanwhile, Francis tries to force Sophia to leave with him in the car, but she runs him over and returns to the villa. She too discovers the dummy room and witnesses Maximilian bludgeoning Carlos to death while Carlos tries to revive Lisa, so Maximilian al
