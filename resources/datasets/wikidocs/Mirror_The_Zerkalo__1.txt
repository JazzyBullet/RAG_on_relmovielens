A Kozyrev mirror (Russian: Зеркало Козырева, romanized: Zerkalo Kozyreva), in Russian esoteric literature from the 1990s, is a pseudoscientific device made from long sheets of aluminum (sometimes from glass, or a reflecting, mirror-like material) curled into a cylindrical spiral.  It is alleged to focus different types of radiation, including that coming from biological objects, when those objects are placed inside it.  Kozyrev mirrors were used in experiments related to extrasensory perception (ESP), conducted in the Institute of Experimental Medicine of Siberia, division of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
