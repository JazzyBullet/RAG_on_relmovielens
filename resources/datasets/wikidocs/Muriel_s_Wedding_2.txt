In 2017 it was announced that the Sydney production (and cast) were going to be transferring to Toronto's Ed Mirvish Theatre, in April 2018. However, the North American premiere was later postponed due to "scheduling conflicts", with producer David Mirvish planning to stage the show in a subsequent season.


=== Australian tour (2019) ===
The musical embarked national tour beginning 12 March 2019 at Her Majesty's Theatre in Melbourne. The production then opened at the Sydney Lyric Theatre on 28 June and was followed by the Queensland Performing Arts Centre in Brisbane from 19 September.
With McKenna performing in the Dear Evan Hansen US tour and Jones joining the Melbourne cast of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, casting began in September 2018 for two new female leads. On 7 October it was announced that Natalie Abbott would be making her professional debut as Muriel alongside Elizabeth Esguerra as Rhonda. Days before opening, amidst several rumours it was announced that Esguerra had been removed from the production, with official releases stating "personal reasons", and she was replaced by her first understudy, Stefanie Jones.

== Reception ==
Muriel's Wedding received very positive critical responses. The Sydney Morning Herald commented that: "Muriel's Wedding feels like the complete package: a beloved film seamlessly updated; a central character who retains all the ambiguities that made you root for her in the first place; a conspicuously inventive score peppered with classic pop hits, and a mainstage debut that will be talked about for years. Adapting his own screenplay to the stage and into the social media present, PJ Hogan's book amplifies the Cinderella aspects of Muriel's story without sacrificing the satirical and melancholic elements that gave the film its depth and heart."


=== Awards and nominations ===
Muriel's Wedding received seven 2017 Sydney Theatre Awards, including Best Production of a Mainstage Musical and Best Original Score of a Mainstage Production, as well as for its direction, choreography, musical direction, Jones as female actor in a supporting role in a musical, and McKenna as newcomer. It was nominated for Best New Australian Work, and in four other categories.
Its text received the 2018 AWGIE Award for Music Theatre, and the AWGIE Awards' David Williamson awar
