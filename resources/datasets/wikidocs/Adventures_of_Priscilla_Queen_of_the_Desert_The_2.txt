There were two soundtrack albums recorded by Polydor Records (Australia) at Trackdown Digital for Stephan Elliott's 1994 Academy Award winning film The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. The first consists of tracks for the film that were sourced from hit records, and the second is the original music score composed by leading Australian film composer Guy Gross.
