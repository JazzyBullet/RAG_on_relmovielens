Young Woman and the Sea is a 2024 American biographical sports drama film directed by Joachim Rønning and written by Jeff Nathanson, based on the 2009 book of the same name by Glenn Stout. Produced by Walt Disney Pictures and Jerry Bruckheimer Films, the film stars Daisy Ridley as Gertrude Ederle, an American competitive swimmer who became the first woman to swim across the English Channel. It also stars Tilda Cobham-Hervey, Stephen Graham, Kim Bodnia, Christopher Eccleston, and Glenn Fleshler in supporting roles.
Development on the film began in 2015 after producer Jerry Bruckheimer acquired the film rights to the book, and established a distribution deal with Paramount Pictures, with Nathanson attached to write it and Lily James cast as Ederle. Paramount eventually put the project in turnaround. In 2020, Walt Disney Pictures acquired the project with Ridley set to portray Ederle and Rønning to direct it. Principal photography took place between May and June 2022. Originally set for release on the streaming service Disney+, Disney opted to release the film theatrically after positive test screenings.
Young Woman and the Sea premiered in Los Angeles on May 16, 2024 and received a limited theatrical release by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures on May 31, 2024. It received positive reviews from critics, who praised Ridley's performance.
