"A Little Less Sixteen Candles, a Little More 'Touch Me'", is a song by American rock band Fall Out Boy and the third and last single taken from their second studio album, From Under the Cork Tree (2005). "A Little Less Sixteen Candles, a Little More 'Touch Me'" was released to radio on March 14, 2006. Released in 2006, though the song never reached the popularity that previous singles "Sugar, We're Goin Down" and "Dance, Dance" achieved, it received moderate playtime on both pop radio and alternative rock radio stations and peaked at No. 65 on the US Billboard Hot 100. The video also reached No. 1 on TRL on both May 5 and May 8, 2006, being the third consecutive single from the album to reach the top position.
The song was originally titled "A Little Less Molly Ringwald, a Little More Samantha Fox". Molly Ringwald is an actress who starred in the 1984 movie Sixteen Candles, referenced in the final song title. "Touch Me" is a reference to the hit song by Samantha Fox. The accompanying music video to "A Little Less Sixteen Candles, a Little More 'Touch Me'" was nominated for Best Video Inspired by a Film at the First Annual Fuse Fangoria Chainsaw Awards 2006.
