Sugar Town is a 1999 independent film co-written and co-directed by Allison Anders and Kurt Voss, concerning a tangled web of characters coping with ambition, fame, and the aftermath of fame.  The film was named after the 1966 hit single "Sugar Town" by Nancy Sinatra.
Anders was eager to make another film about the music industry after her earlier films Border Radio and Grace of My Heart.  After her friend John Taylor had left Duran Duran and was beginning to launch an acting career, she and Voss wrote the film fairly quickly, and cast several musical friends of hers in the convoluted plot.
The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 26, 1999, where it received a distribution deal with October Films and USA Films.  Sugar Town was then shown in limited release in the United States in September of that year, before appearing at several overseas film festivals.
