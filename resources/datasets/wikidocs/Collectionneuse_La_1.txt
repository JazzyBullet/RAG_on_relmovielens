La Collectionneuse (The Collector) is a 1967 French comedy-drama film directed by Ã‰ric Rohmer. The third entry in his Six Moral Tales series, it is his first film in colour.
Set on the south coast of France in August, it portrays the shifting relationships between four very different characters who, as in the comedies of Marivaux, play games of love and chance. The girl, who seduces two of the men and resists the third, is called the collectionneuse.
The film won the Silver Bear Extraordinary Jury Prize at the 17th Berlin International Film Festival. It is often considered one of Rohmer's best films.
