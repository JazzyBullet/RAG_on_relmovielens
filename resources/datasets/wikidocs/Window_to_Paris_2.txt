Yuri Mamin (Russian: Юрий Борисович Мамин) is a Soviet and Russian film director, stage director, screenwriter, composer, author and television host. He created a number of movies popular in Russia including Neptune's Feast (1986), Fontain (1988), Sideburns, (1990), Window to Paris (1993), and Don't Think About White Monkeys (2008). He is a Merited Artist of the Russian Federation.
Yuri Mamin is the only person in Russia to have won the Chaplin's Golden Cane award.  The award was presented by Charlie Chaplin's widow, Oona Chaplin, at the festival marking 100 years since the birth of the great comedian.  The festival was held in the Swiss city of Vevey, where Chaplin was buried.
Mamin's works are known for a strong emphasis on social justice and criticism of hypocritical social norms. Because of this, he found difficult to find support for his productions in the totalitarian USSR, as well as in today's Russia, where film makers became dependent on corporate oligarchy. His characters often portray an inspired citizen in the fight for social justice against corporate capitalism.
Mamin's films received numerous grand prizes and other awards.
