Three Seasons (Vietnamese title: Ba MÃ¹a) is a 1999 Vietnamese-American film, shot in Vietnam, about the past, present, and future of Ho Chi Minh City in the early days of Doi Moi.  It is a poetic film that tries to paint a picture of the urban culture undergoing westernization.  The movie takes place in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon.  As the characters try to come to terms with the invasion of capitalism, neon signs, grand 5-star hotels, and Coca-Cola signs, their paths begin to merge.
This was the first American film to be made in Vietnam after Bill Clinton lifted the embargo. The filmmakers were followed by Vietnamese inspectors throughout filming.
