Matt Zoller Seitz, in a review for RogerEbert.com stated: "De Niro, bless his heart, is the engine that keeps this refurbished jalopy puttering along for 90 minutes. There are a couple of scenes that suggest the stronger, more fascinating movie that might've been". InSession Film's M.N. Miller called Maniscalco's film "A culture clash farce that works because of Maniscalco's style of comedy and De Niro playing to his long-established comic strengths as a cynical curmudgeon set in his ways."
