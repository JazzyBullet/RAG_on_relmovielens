Shiloh (; Hebrew: שִׁלֹה, שִׁלוֹ ,שִׁילֹה, שִׁילוֹ, romanized: Šīlō) was an ancient city and sanctuary in ancient Israel located in the region of Samaria. According to the Hebrew Bible, Shiloh was one of the main centers of Israelite worship during the pre-monarchic period, before the First Temple in Jerusalem was built. After the Israelite conquest of Canaan, the Tabernacle was moved to Shiloh, and remained there during the period of the biblical judges.
Shiloh has been positively identified with modern Khirbet Seilun, a tell known in Modern Hebrew as Tel Shiloh. It is located 31 kilometres (19 mi) north of Jerusalem, in the West Bank, to the west of the modern Israeli settlement town of Shilo and to the north of the Palestinian town of Turmus Ayya. Relative to other archaeological sites, it is south of the biblical town of Lebonah and 16 kilometres (10 mi) north of Bethel. G. F. Moore has suggested identifying Bochim as Shiloh.
