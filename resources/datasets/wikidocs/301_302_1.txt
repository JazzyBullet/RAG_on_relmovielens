301, 302 or 301/302 is a 1995 South Korean film directed by Park Chul-soo. It tells the story of two South Korean women, neighbors in the same apartment building, who take very different approaches to the difficulties of modern life; one indulges in food, sex, and spending while the other lives in self-imposed austerity. The film was selected as the South Korean entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 68th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.
The film was inspired by poet Jang Jung Ill's poem "The Cook and the Anorexic."
Compulsion, a 2013 Canadian psychological thriller directed by Egidio Coccimiglio, is based on this film.
