Venom: The Last Dance is an upcoming American superhero film featuring the Marvel Comics character Venom, produced by Columbia Pictures in association with Marvel, and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. It is intended to be the sequel to Venom (2018) and Venom: Let There Be Carnage (2021) and the fifth film in Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU). Written and directed by Kelly Marcel, the film stars Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock and Venom, alongside Juno Temple, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Clark Backo.
Hardy revealed in August 2018 that he was signed on to appear in a third and final Venom film, and development had begun by December 2021, after the second film was released. Marcel and Hardy were writing the script by June 2022, and Marcel was set to make her directorial debut with the film that October. New cast members, including Temple and Ejiofor, joined in mid-2023, and filming began at the end of June in Spain. Production was halted the next month due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike and resumed that November after the strike ended. The title was revealed in March 2024, at which point filming was nearly completed.
Venom: The Last Dance is scheduled to be released in the United States on October 25, 2024.
