H.O.T.S. is a 1979 American sex comedy. The film stars three Playboy Playmates â€” Susan Kiger (January 1977), Pamela Bryant (April, 1978), and Sandy Johnson (June, 1974), as well as former Miss USA of 1972, Lindsay Bloom, sexploitation actress Angela Aames, and later genre movie veteran Lisa London in her film debut.  Danny Bonaduce appears in a supporting role.
The cast frequently appears in tight white T-shirts with the H.O.T.S. logo and red-orange shorts. Some reviewers believe this wardrobe inspired the Hooters uniforms.


== Plot ==
Honey Shayne is a freshman at Fairenville University (known, according to a title card, as "Good old F.U."). After unsuccessfully pledging the Pi sorority, and being publicly ridiculed by sorority president Melody Ragmore, Honey joins with three other unsuccessful pledges (O'Hara, Teri, and Samantha to form a new sorority (to be known as H.O.T.S. after their initials) with the goal of stealing all of the rival sorority's boyfriends.
The movie includes a number of competitions intended to accomplish that goal, including a fundraiser (a kissing booth), a dance, and a climactic game of strip football. Both groups play pranks on the other and attempt to avoid disciplinary actions from the F.U. administration. A subplot deals with the attempts of two bungling gangsters to recover money hidden in the renovated building housing the sorority.
A running gag during the movie is the source of the name "H.O.T.S."  While the closing credits reveal that the name is an anagram of the first names of the four founders, other characters in the film believe it to stand for Hands Off Those Suckers and Hold On To Sex. At one point, the girls claim it stands for Help Out The Seals.

=== Critical response ===
Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, which collects both contemporary and modern reviews, gives the film a score of 29% based on reviews from 7 critics.
A review at The Video Graveyard found that "It lacks any real focus instead going for an "everything but the kitchen sink" attitude in its attempts to ape Animal House every chance it gets. Granted, it could've been yet another forgettable, toss-away T&A effort like Cherry Hill High and a ton of other mid-70s flicks were but a lot of why it's somewhat watchable should be credited to its good-natured cast, plentiful bare boobs, and that sweet, sweet huddle cam".
