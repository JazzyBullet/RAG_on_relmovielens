== Response ==
Life Magazine called the musical "a French fairy tale for wicked grown-ups who want to believe in love" and praised Seal. "Elizabeth Seal is an ideal Irma, tender, breezy, and totally implausible as a bad girl...the season's new favorite." "Another asset is Clive Revill...who provides the right clowning touch."
