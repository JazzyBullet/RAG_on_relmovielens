Yatsuse Hiiragi, a first-year high school student, is the type of person who cannot refuse requests because he wants to get along well with the people around him and not be disliked by them. However, nothing he does goes well and he has no one he can call a best friend. One summer day when it snows out of season, he meets Tsumugi, a demon girl who has come to the human world looking for her mother. Tsumugi, who has a personality opposite to Hiiragi and does not care about what others think of her, takes Hiiragi on her journey.
