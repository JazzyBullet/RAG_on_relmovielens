Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2 (or Baby Geniuses 2: Superbabies or Baby Geniuses 2) is a 2004 American family action comedy film directed by Bob Clark and written by Gregory Poppen, from a story by Steven Paul. The sequel to the 1999 film Baby Geniuses, it stars Jon Voight, Scott Baio, and Vanessa Angel. Following the events of the first film, four babies can communicate with each other using baby talk and have knowledge of many secrets. The baby geniuses become involved in a scheme by media mogul Bill Biscane, later revealed to be known as Kane, who kidnaps children everywhere. Helping the geniuses is a legendary super-baby named Kahuna who stops Biscane's plots and saves children from being kidnapped by Biscane and his minions. He joins up with several other babies in an attempt to stop Biscane, who intends to use a state-of-the-art satellite system to control the world's population by brainwashing them and forcing people to not be active and watch TV for the rest of their lives.
Like its predecessor, Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2 was panned by audiences and critics alike and is often regarded as one of the worst films of all time. It was a box-office bomb, earning less than half its budget back and was nominated at the 25th Golden Raspberry Awards for Worst Picture. It is the final film Bob Clark directed before his death in 2007. Three direct-to-video sequels followed the film, Baby Geniuses and the Mystery of the Crown Jewels (2013), Baby Geniuses and the Treasure of Egypt (2014), Baby Geniuses and the Space Baby (2015), with Voight appearing as various characters throughout the series.
