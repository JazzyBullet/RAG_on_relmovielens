The Newton Gang (ca. 1919 through 1924) was an outlaw gang of the early 20th century, who engaged in train robbery and bank robbery. From 1919 through 1924 the gang robbed dozens of banks, claiming a total of seventy-five banks and six trains.  According to Willis Newton, the brothers "took in more money than the Dalton Gang, Butch Cassidy's Wild Bunch and the James-Younger Gang combined." 
According to their own claims, they never killed anyone although it has been reported that "they did on occasion shoot, pistol-whip and beat their victims"
A 1924 train robbery near Rondout, Illinois was their most famous crime. In 1975, they participated in a documentary film, and then a more in-depth oral history project. This second round of fame led to a feature film being produced by a major Hollywood studio, after the death of the last surviving brother.
