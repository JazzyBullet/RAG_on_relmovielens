Djibril Diop Mambéty (January 1945 – July 23, 1998) was a Senegalese film director, actor, orator, composer and poet.  Though he made only five feature films and two short documentary films, they received international acclaim for their original and experimental cinematic technique and non-linear, unconventional narrative style.
Born to a Muslim family near Dakar, Senegal's capital city, Mambéty was an ethnic Wolof. He died in 1998 while being treated for lung cancer in a Paris hospital.
