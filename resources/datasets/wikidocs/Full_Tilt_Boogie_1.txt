== Poster ==
When the time came for the poster of From Dusk till Dawn to be created, Rodriguez, who has final approval for all such merchandise relating to his films, commissioned a design from one of his favorite artists, fantasy painter Frank Frazetta. The piece was ultimately not used, but its influence can clearly be seen on the poster for Full Tilt Boogie.


== Reception ==
Despite being released two years after its subject – the popular film From Dusk Till Dawn – Full-Tilt Boogie was well received, with an 88% on review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes. David Stratton of Variety Film Reviews remarked, "A bit late in the day, but nevertheless welcome."
It was praised by Ryan Cracknell of the Apollo Guide for being "a tribute to the people who work behind the camera, but don't normally compete for golden statues on Oscar night."
