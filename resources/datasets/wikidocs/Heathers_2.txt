Heathers: The Musical is a musical with music, lyrics and book by Laurence O'Keefe and Kevin Murphy, based on the 1989 film of the same name written by Daniel Waters. The producers include J. Todd Harris, Amy Powers, RJ Hendricks, and Andy Cohen. After a sold-out Los Angeles tryout, the show moved Off-Broadway in 2014. After the run in 2014, the show had an Off-West End run in 2018 and then transferred to the West End in 2018 for a limited engagement. In 2022, Roku released the Off-West end version of Heathers on their streaming service for free.
The show is a high-energy black comedy and involves dark subject matter, including bullying, teen suicide, sexual assault, and school violence.
