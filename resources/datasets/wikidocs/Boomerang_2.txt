Boomerang is an American cable television network and subscription video on-demand over-the-top streaming service owned by Warner Bros. Discovery U.S. Networks, a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Discovery. It primarily features animated programming from the Warner Bros. Animation library (including Warner Bros. Cartoons and Hanna-Barbera productions among others), as well as contemporary reboots of classic franchises.
Boomerang debuted in 1992 as a programming block on Cartoon Network, and was originally dedicated to classic animation. The block was eventually spun-off into its own separate network in 2000, and by the late 2000s, began airing more modern and contemporary programming, including reruns of Cartoon Network original series. A 2015 relaunch aimed to promote Boomerang as a "second flagship" brand alongside Cartoon Network, and saw the network produce its own original programming; with a focus on reboots of franchises such as Looney Tunes and Scooby-Doo. In 2017, as the cable network was losing coverage, Boomerang launched its own standalone SVOD app.
As of November 2023, the Boomerang cable network is available to approximately 26,000,000 pay television households in the United States; down from its 2019 peak of 47,000,000 households.
