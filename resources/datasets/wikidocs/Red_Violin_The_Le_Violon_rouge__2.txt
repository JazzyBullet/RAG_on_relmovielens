The Red Violin is the original soundtrack album, on the Sony Classical label, of the 1999 film The Red Violin (original title: Le violon rouge), starring Carlo Cecchi, Sandra Oh and Samuel L. Jackson. The original score and songs were composed by John Corigliano and performed by Philharmonia Orchestra with Esa-Pekka Salonen conducting.
The album won the Academy Award for Best Original Score and was nominated for a Grammy Award: Best Instrumental Composition Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media (lost to the score of A Bug's Life).

Film director Fran√ßois Girard stated violinist Joshua Bell and Corigliano were involved from the outset and reviewed every version of the screenplay as it was in development.
Much of the score had to be written before principal photography, which is rare in film.  After shooting completed, Corigliano finished "Anna's Theme".
