Romeo Must Die: The Album is the soundtrack to Andrzej Bartkowiak's 2000 action film Romeo Must Die, composed of hip hop and R&B music. It was released on March 28, 2000 through Blackground Records and Virgin Records in association with Warner Bros. Records (who helped co-financed the soundtrack). Recording sessions took time between May 1999 and January 2000.
Production was handled by several record producers, including Irv Gotti, Rapture Stewart, Ant Banks, Eric Seats, Mannie Fresh, J Dub, and Timbaland, who also served as executive producer along with Barry and Jomo Hankerson, and the film star Aaliyah.
It features contributions from Aaliyah, who appears on fours songs, as well as B.G., Chant√© Moore, Dave Hollister, Destiny's Child, Ginuwine, Joe, Lil' Mo, Mack 10, Playa, Stanley Clarke, The Comrads and more.
Three singles and music videos were released from the album: Aaliyah's number one pop hit "Try Again" (directed by Wayne Isham), Aaliyah and her co-star DMX duet "Come Back in One Piece" (directed by Little X), and Timbaland & Magoo's "We At It Again" (directed by Chris Robinson), which introduced Timbaland's younger brother, rapper Sebastian, to audiences. Q magazine included the soundtrack album in their list of the '5 Best Compilations of 2000'.
In August 2021, it was reported that Aaliyah's recorded work for Blackground (since rebranded as Blackground Records 2.0) would be re-released on physical, digital, and, for the first time ever, streaming services in a deal between the label and Empire Distribution. Romeo Must Die: The Album was re-released on September 3, 2021.
