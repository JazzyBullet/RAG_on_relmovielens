Alice in Wonderland syndrome (AIWS), also known as Todd's syndrome or dysmetropsia, is a neurological disorder that distorts perception. People with this syndrome may experience distortions in their visual perception of objects, such as appearing smaller (micropsia) or larger (macropsia), or appearing to be closer (pelopsia) or farther (teleopsia) than they are. Distortion may also occur for senses other than vision.
The cause of Alice in Wonderland syndrome is currently not known, but it has often been associated with migraines, head trauma, or viral encephalitis caused by Epsteinâ€“Barr virus infection. It is also theorized that AIWS can be caused by abnormal amounts of electrical activity, resulting in abnormal blood flow in the parts of the brain that process visual perception and texture.
Although there are cases of Alice in Wonderland syndrome in both adolescents and adults, it is most commonly seen in children.
