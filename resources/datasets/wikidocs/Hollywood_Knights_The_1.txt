The Hollywood Knights is a 1980 American teen comedy film written and directed by Floyd Mutrux. It depicts the crass and mischievous antics and practical jokes of the remaining members of a 1950s-era car club turned social fraternity in and around Beverly Hills and Hollywood in 1965. The cast, led by Robert Wuhl as the fraternity's charismatic leader, features Tony Danza and Michelle Pfeiffer in their film debuts, as well as Gailard Sartain, Fran Drescher, and Stuart Pankin in supporting roles.
It was the inaugural film credit of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment (as PolyGram Pictures), a British studio that aimed to compete with Hollywood.
