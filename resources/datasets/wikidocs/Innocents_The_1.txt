The Massacre (or Slaughter) of the Innocents is a biblical story recounted in the Nativity narrative of the Gospel of Matthew (2:16â€“18) in which Herod the Great, king of Judea, orders the execution of all male children who are two years old and under in the vicinity of Bethlehem. "Most New Testament scholars do not regard the stories of the magi, the massacre of the innocents, and the flight to Egypt as historical,136 so in this sense they are myth. But they are also mythical in the sense of conveying sacred truths." Some Christians venerate the Holy Innocents as the first Christian martyrs, but modern scholarship finds no evidence that it happened outside the passages in Matthew.
The Feast of the Holy Innocents, also known as Childermas, is celebrated in the Western Christian Churches on 28 December, the fourth day of Christmastide. In Eastern Christianity, the feast is celebrated on various dates, depending on the denomination.
