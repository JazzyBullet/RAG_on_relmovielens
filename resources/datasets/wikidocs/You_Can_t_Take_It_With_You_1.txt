You Can't Take It with You is a comedic play in three acts by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart.  The original production of the play premiered at the Chestnut Street Opera House in Philadelphia on November 30, 1936. The production transferred to Broadway's Booth Theatre on December 14, 1936 where it played for 838 performances.
The play won the 1937 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, and was adapted for the screen as You Can't Take It with You in 1938, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture and Best Director.
The play is popular among theater programs of high school institutions, and has been one of the 10 most-produced school plays every year since amateur rights became available in 1939.
