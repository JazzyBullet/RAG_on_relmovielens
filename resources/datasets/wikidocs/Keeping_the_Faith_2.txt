"Keeping the Faith" is a song by rock singer-songwriter Billy Joel, from his 1983 album An Innocent Man, serving as its closing track and the final single released from the album. The cover for the single shows an image of Joel and the judge (character actor Richard Shull) in the "jukebox" courtroom from the video. 
It reached No. 18 on the main US Billboard Hot 100 chart and No. 3 on the US Billboard Adult Contemporary chart. The song was the only single from the album that failed to chart on the UK Singles Chart, despite the success of An Innocent Man in the United Kingdom.
