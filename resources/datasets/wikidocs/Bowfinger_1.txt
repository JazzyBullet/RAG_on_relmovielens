Bowfinger is a 1999 American satirical buddy comedy film directed by Frank Oz. The film depicts a down-and-out filmmaker in Hollywood attempting to make a film on a small budget with a star who does not know that he is in the movie. It was written by Steve Martin, who also stars alongside Eddie Murphy in two roles, and Heather Graham as an ambitious would-be starlet.
Bowfinger was released in the United States on August 13, 1999, to positive reviews, and grossed $98 million. The film is considered by many as one of Eddie Murphy's best and most underappreciated films.
