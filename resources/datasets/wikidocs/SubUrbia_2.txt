SubUrbia is a play by Eric Bogosian chronicling the nighttime activities of a group of aimless 20-somethings still living in their suburbian New Jersey hometown and their reunion with a former high school classmate, Pony, who has become a successful musician. Pony's return strips away illusions and excuses to reveal the meaningless dead-end existences of everyone.
