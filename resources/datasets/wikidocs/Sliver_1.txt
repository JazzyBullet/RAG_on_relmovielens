Sliver is a 1993 American erotic thriller film starring Sharon Stone, William Baldwin, and Tom Berenger. It is based on the Ira Levin novel of the same name about the mysterious occurrences in a privately owned New York high-rise sliver building. Phillip Noyce directed the film, from a screenplay by Joe Eszterhas. Because of a major battle with the MPAA (which originally gave the film an NC-17 rating), the filmmakers were forced to make extensive reshoots before release. These reshoots actually necessitated changing the killer's identity.
Released theatrically on May 21, 1993, by Paramount Pictures, the film underperformed at the box office domestically, but proved a bigger hit overseas. Sliver, like many erotic thrillers of the time, found great success in the home video market, and was the 8th most rented film in the United States for 1994.
