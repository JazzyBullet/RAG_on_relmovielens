Lured  is a 1947 American film noir directed by Douglas Sirk and starring George Sanders, Lucille Ball, Charles Coburn, and Boris Karloff. The film is a remake of 1939 French film Pièges directed by Robert Siodmak, which was titled Personal Column in the United States; Personal Column was also the title of this film when it was originally released.  It did not do good business under that name – the code administration was concerned that some people thought the film was titled "LURID", so United Artists pulled it from circulation, and subsequently re-released it with the current title.
The film's sets were designed by the art director Nicolai Remisoff.
