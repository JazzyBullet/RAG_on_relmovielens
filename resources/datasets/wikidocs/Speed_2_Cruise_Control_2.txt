Speed 2: Cruise Control is the soundtrack album for the 1997 film of the same name.  It was released by Virgin Records in May 1997, nearly a month before the film's release. Because of the film's Caribbean setting, the soundtrack features a variety of reggae music from artists including Common Sense, Jimmy Cliff, Maxi Priest and Shaggy.  UB40, Carlinhos Brown and Tamia also have songs on the soundtrack, and appear in the film as entertainers on the cruise ship.
In addition to reggae, the soundtrack features a techno remix of the film score by Tetsuya "TK" Komuro and an R&B song by Tamia (which is sung by her character in the film). Many of the songs were first released on the soundtrack, and five were released as singles.  The soundtrack received mixed reviews from critics, although it was praised for featuring reggae music.
