Gerald Norman Springer (February 13, 1944 – April 27, 2023) was an American broadcaster, journalist, actor, lawyer, and politician. He was best known for hosting the controversial tabloid talk show Jerry Springer from 1991 to 2018. He was noted as a pioneer in the emergence of "trash TV"; his eponymous show was a "commercial smash and certifiable cultural phenomenon" in the 1990s.
Born in London during World War II to German Jewish refugees escaping the Holocaust, Springer was raised in Queens, New York City. He attended Northwestern University School of Law, qualified as a lawyer, and first became actively involved in politics working for the campaign of Robert Kennedy in 1968. A Cincinnati City Council member, Springer served as the 56th Mayor of Cincinnati from 1977 to 1978. He then worked as a local news anchor in Cincinnati where he won ten Regional Emmy Awards for commentary. 
From 2005 to 2006, Springer hosted Springer on the Radio, a liberal talk show on Cincinnati's WCKY-AM. He was the host of the television talent show America's Got Talent from 2007 to 2008, and of the television courtroom show Judge Jerry from 2019 to 2022. He also hosted The Jerry Springer Podcast from 2015 to 2022. One year after he retired from his television career, Springer died of pancreatic cancer on April 27, 2023 at the age of 79.


== Early life ==
Gerald Norman Springer was born on February 13, 1944, in the London Underground's Highgate station while the station was in use as a shelter from German bombing during World War II. Springer grew up on Chandos Road, East Finchley. His parents, Margot 
(née Kallmann; a bank clerk) and Richard Springer (owner of a shoe shop), were Jewish German refugees who escaped from Landsberg an der Warthe, Prussia (now Gorzów Wielkopolski, Poland). 
His maternal grandmother, Marie Kallmann, was killed in the gas vans of Chełmno extermination camp in German-occupied Poland. His paternal grandmother, Selma Springer (née Elkeles), died at the hospital in the Theresienstadt concentration camp in German-occupied Czechoslovakia.  Selma Springer's brother, Hermann Elkeles, was a renowned Berlin doctor who also died at Theresienstadt concentration camp.
In January 1949, when Springer was four, his family emigrated to the United States, settling in the Kew Gardens neighborhood of Queens, a borough of New York City. He attended nearby Forest Hills High School. One of his earliest memories about current events was when he was 12 and watching the 1956 Democratic National Convention on television where he saw and was impressed by then-Senator John F. Kennedy.
Springer earned a Bachelor of Arts from Tulane University in 1965, majoring in political science. He earned a Juris Doctor from Northwestern University in 1968.
