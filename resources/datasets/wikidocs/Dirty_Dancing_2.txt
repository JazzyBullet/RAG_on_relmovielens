Dirty Dancing: Original Soundtrack from the Vestron Motion Picture is the original soundtrack to the 1987 film Dirty Dancing. It was released on August 4, 1987, by RCA Records. The album went on to sell 32 million copies worldwide and is one of the best-selling albums of all time.
In the United States, the album spent 18 weeks at number one on the Billboard 200 chart and has been certified 14-times Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). With shipments of at least 3.25 million copies, it is the all-time best-selling album in Germany.
A follow-up album, More Dirty Dancing, was released in March 1988. The album Ultimate Dirty Dancing, released in December 2003, contains every song from the motion picture Dirty Dancing in the order it appears in the film.
Due to the strong resurgence of vinyl record sales, for the film's 30th anniversary in 2017, Dirty Dancing received a vinyl reissue, along with a Blu-Ray remaster with a 5.1 surround soundtrack and previously unreleased material.
