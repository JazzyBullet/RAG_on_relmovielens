Strawberry and Chocolate (Spanish: Fresa y chocolate) is a 1993 internationally co-produced film, directed by Cuban filmmakers Tomás Gutiérrez Alea and Juan Carlos Tabío, based on the short story "The Wolf, The Forest and the New Man" (in Spanish, El Lobo, el bosque y el hombre nuevo).  Senel Paz had witten the short story in 1990, and also wrote the screenplay for the film.  It was the first Cuban film to be nominated for an Academy Award.
