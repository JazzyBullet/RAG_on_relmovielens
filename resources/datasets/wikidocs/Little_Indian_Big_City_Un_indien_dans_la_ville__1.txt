== Release ==
Un indien dans la ville opened in France on 14 December 1994. Shortly after its release in France, Disney saw this film as a possibility to attract a family audience in the United States and considered giving it a limited release in select cities. Before releasing it in select cities, Disney decided to release it under their Touchstone Pictures label as they felt this film had some mature themes for an ordinary Disney film.
As opposed to releasing it in the United States with subtitles leaving the original French dialogue in, Disney hired many cartoon voice-over actors to dub the original French dialogue out and substitute it with an English language format. They also gave the film an English name, Little Indian, Big City. Under its new Americanized title and language dubbing, Touchstone released it to a select American audience on March 22, 1996.

=== Box office ===
Un indien dans la ville grossed 21 million Franc ($3.9 million) in its opening week in France, finishing second behind The Lion King.

The film flopped during its American release; the film opened in 545 theaters in the United States, but eventually only grossed $1,029,731 in the US and Canada theatrically.

He ended his original Chicago Sun Times newspaper review by saying "If you under any circumstances see Little Indian, Big City, I will never let you read one of my reviews again". Ebert's colleague Gene Siskel also deplored the film saying that it was likely to be a candidate for the year's (or any year's) worst film. He also said that if the word for the film got big enough in the United States family audiences would have been "hoodwinked into paying to see a totally unprofessional movie." When Siskel and Ebert viewed the film during its original theatrical release, one of the film reels broke out and the third reel of film was missing. A film executive informed Siskel and Ebert that they were allowed to come back the following week and view the particular reel. Siskel and Ebert came back to view the third reel, and by the time they had concluded viewing the whole film Siskel was
