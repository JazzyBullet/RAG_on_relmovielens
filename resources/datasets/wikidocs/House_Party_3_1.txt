House Party 3 is a 1994 American comedy film, starring Kid 'n Play, Bernie Mac, Gilbert Gottfried, TLC, Immature, Michael Colyar, and introducing Angela Means in her film debut as Veda Pratt with a special appearance by Tisha Campbell. It is the third installment of the House Party film series. This was intended to be the last film in the franchise, ending it as a trilogy, but a stand-alone direct to video sequel, House Party 4: Down to the Last Minute, was released seven years later. This is also Chris Tucker's debut on film as well as the first film in the series that Martin Lawrence does not reprise his role as Bilal, nor was he mentioned. Also absent in House Party 3 are three of the members of the R&B group Full Force, who played the bullies in the first two films.
