Let's Talk About Sex is a 1998 American dramatic film written, directed, and starring Troy Beyer.
The film was originally rated NC-17 by the MPAA, but was edited for an R-rating. According to Beyer, among other items the MPAA would have required to give the film a lower rating, Beyer was asked to remove a scene where a fully dressed woman licks a peach in demonstration of cunnilingus. Beyer says that the scene was "heartfelt... It wasn't vulgar or demeaning to anyone." Regarding her experience with the MPAA, Beyer said, "I felt violated. I felt raped artistically."
The film has aired numerous times uncut on French television.
