The New York Post (NY Post) is an American conservative daily tabloid newspaper published in New York City. The Post also operates three online sites: NYPost.com; PageSix.com, a gossip site; and Decider.com, an entertainment site.
The newspaper was founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton, a Federalist and Founding Father who was appointed the nation's first Secretary of the Treasury by George Washington. The newspaper became a respected broadsheet in the 19th century, under the name New York Evening Post. Its most notable 19th-century editor was William Cullen Bryant. 
In the mid-20th century, the newspaper was owned by Dorothy Schiff, who developed the tabloid format that has been used since by the newspaper. In 1976, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp bought the Post for US$30.5 million (equivalent to $163 million in 2023). 
The New York Post is the ninth-largest circulation newspaper in the U.S. as of 2023.

The Post was founded by Alexander Hamilton with about US$10,000 (equivalent to $183,120 in 2023) from a group of investors in the autumn of 1801 as the New-York Evening Post, a broadsheet. Hamilton's co-investors included other New York members of the Federalist Party, including Robert Troup and Oliver Wolcott who were dismayed by the election of Thomas Jefferson as U.S. president and the rise in popularity of the Democratic-Republican Party.: 74  At a meeting held at Archibald Gracie's weekend villa, which is now Gracie Mansion, Hamilton recruited the first investors for the new paper. Hamilton chose William Coleman as his first editor.: 74 
The most notable 19th-century Evening Post editor was the poet and abolitionist William Cullen Bryant.: 90  So well respected was the Evening Post under Bryant's editorship, it received praise from the English philosopher John Stuart Mill, in 1864.
In addition to literary and drama reviews, William Leggett began to write political editorials for the Post. Leggett's espoused a fierce opposition to central banking and support for the organization of labor unions. He was a member of the Equal Rights Party. In 1831, he became a co-owner and editor of the Post, eventually working as sole editor of the newspaper while Bryant traveled in Europe in 1834 and 1835.
Two additional co-owners of the paper were John Bigelow and Issac Henderson. Born in Malden-on-Hudson, New York, Bigelow graduated in 1835 from Union College, where he was a member of the Sigma Phi Society and the Philomathean Society, and was admitted to the bar in 1838. 
From 1849 to 1861, he was one of the editors and co-owners of the Evening Post.
 
In 1877, this led to the involvement of his son Isaac Henderson Jr., who became the paper's publisher, stockholder, and member of its board, just five years after graduating from college. Henderson Sr.'s 33-year tenure with the Evening Post ended in 1879, when it was learned that he had defrauded Bryant the entire time. Henderson Jr. sold his interest in the newspaper in 1881.
In 1881, Henry Villard took control of the Evening Post and The Nation, which became the Post's weekly edition. With this acquisition, the paper was managed by the triumvirate of Carl Schurz, Horace White, and Edwin L. Godkin. When Schurz left the paper in 1883, Godkin became editor-in-chief. White became editor-in-chief in 1899, and remained in that role until his retirement in 1903.
In 1897, both publications passed to the management of Villard's son, Oswald Garrison Villard, a founding member of both the NAACP and the American Anti-Imperialist League.: 257

Villard sold the newspaper in 1918 following widespread allegations of pro-German sympathies during World War I hurt the newspaper's circulation. The new owner was Thomas Lamont, a senior partner in the Wall Street firm of J.P. Morgan & Co. Unable to stem the paper's financial losses, he sold it to a consortium of 34 financial and reform political leaders, headed by Edwin Francis Gay, dean of the Harv
