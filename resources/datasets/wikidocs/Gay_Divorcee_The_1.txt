The Gay Divorcee is a 1934 American musical film directed by Mark Sandrich and starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.  It also features Alice Brady, Edward Everett Horton, Eric Blore and Erik Rhodes. The screenplay was written by George Marion Jr., Dorothy Yost and Edward Kaufman. It is based on the Broadway musical, Gay Divorce, written by Dwight Taylor, with Kenneth S. Webb and Samuel Hoffenstein, adapting an unproduced play by J. Hartley Manners.
The stage version included many songs by Cole Porter that were left out of the film, except for "Night and Day". Although most of the songs were replaced, the screenplay kept the original plot of the stage version. Three members of the play's original cast repeated their stage roles: Astaire, Rhodes and Blore.
The Gay Divorcee was the second (after Flying Down to Rio) of ten pairings of Astaire and Rogers on film.
