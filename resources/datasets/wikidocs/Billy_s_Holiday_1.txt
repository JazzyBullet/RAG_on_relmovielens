Billy's Holiday is a 1995 Australian musical film.


== Production ==
Screenwriter Denis Whitburn had written a play called The Siege of Frank Sinatra in which Max Cullen had starred in its original 1980 production. During the production Cullen and Whitburn would head out to bars and Cullen would sing in a Billie Holiday voice. In the early 1990s Whitburn decided to write a film about this ability and wrote the script in three weeks.


== Music ==
The opening scene has James Morrison playing "I Can't Get Started" Ã  la Bunny Berigan.
The musical score was written by the late Larry Muhoberac, who won an AFI award that year for Best Musical Score. It was produced in Sydney, Australia, with co-production, instrumental performances and engineering by Parrish Muhoberac.
