Nosferatu is an upcoming American gothic horror film written and directed by Robert Eggers, and starring Bill Skarsgård as Count Orlok. Following Werner Herzog's Nosferatu the Vampyre (1979) and David Lee Fisher's Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horrors (2023), it is the third remake of the 1922 film written by Henrik Galeen and directed by F. W. Murnau, which in turn is an "unauthorized and unofficial" adaptation of Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula.
Development on the film began in 2015, following the release of The Witch. Eggers planned to make it his second film, describing it as a passion project, but eventually opted to delay production and go on to direct The Lighthouse and The Northman instead. Frequent collaborator Anya Taylor-Joy was attached to the project earlier, but dropped out due to scheduling conflicts. Skarsgård and Lily-Rose Depp were cast as leads in September 2022. Nicholas Hoult joined the cast the following month, with the remaining cast confirmed in early 2023. Filming primarily took place in and around Prague between February and May 2023.
Nosferatu is a co-production of Studio 8, and Maiden Voyage Pictures, and is set to be released theatrically on December 25, 2024, by Focus Features.
