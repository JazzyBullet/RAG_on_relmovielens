General elections were held in South Africa on 29 May 2024 to elect a new National Assembly as well as the provincial legislature in each of the nine provinces. This was the seventh general election held under the conditions of universal adult suffrage since the end of the apartheid era in 1994. The new National Council of Provinces (NCOP) will be elected at the first sitting of each provincial legislature.
The election is notable for the decline in support for the African National Congress (ANC) which lost the parliamentary majority that it has held since the inaugural post-apartheid election in 1994, and the rise of uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK) led by former president Jacob Zuma, which came in third place.
