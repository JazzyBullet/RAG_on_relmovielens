RoboCop 3 is a 1993 American science fiction action film directed by Fred Dekker and written by Dekker and Frank Miller. It is the sequel to the 1990 film RoboCop 2 and the third and final entry in the original RoboCop franchise. It stars Robert Burke, Nancy Allen and Rip Torn. Set in the near future in a dystopian metropolitan Detroit, the plot centers on RoboCop (Burke) as he vows to avenge the death of his partner Anne Lewis (Allen) and save Detroit from falling into chaos, while evil conglomerate OCP, run by its CEO (Torn), advances its program to demolish the city and build a new "Delta City" over the former homes of the residents. 
It was filmed in Atlanta, Georgia. Most of the set and background buildings were slated for demolition to make way for facilities in the 1996 Summer Olympics. RoboCop 3 is the first film to use digital morphing in more than one scene.
The film was a critical and commercial failure in the US, grossing $47 million worldwide against its $22 million budget, making it the least profitable film of the RoboCop franchise. Two television series, RoboCop and RoboCop: Prime Directives, were released in 1994 and 2001 respectively, and the film series was rebooted with the 2014 remake RoboCop. A video game midquel, RoboCop: Rogue City (set between RoboCop 2 and RoboCop 3), with Peter Weller reprising his role, was released in 2023.
