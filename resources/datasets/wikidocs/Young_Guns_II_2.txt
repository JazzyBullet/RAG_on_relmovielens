Young Guns is a 1988 American Western action film directed and produced by Christopher Cain and written by John Fusco. The film dramatizes the adventures of Billy the Kid during the Lincoln County War, which took place in New Mexico in 1877–78. It stars Emilio Estevez as Billy, and Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips, Charlie Sheen, Dermot Mulroney and Casey Siemaszko as the other Lincoln County Regulators. The supporting cast features Terence Stamp, Terry O'Quinn, Brian Keith, and Jack Palance.
The first film to be produced by Morgan Creek Productions, Young Guns opened at number one at the US box office and eventually grossed $56 million against an $11-million budget. Because of the film’s cast, it is often associated with the “Brat Pack” set of 1980’s. Historian Paul Hutton called Young Guns the most historically accurate of all Billy the Kid films as of June 1990. 
A sequel, Young Guns II, was released in August 1990, with the principal cast reprising their roles.
