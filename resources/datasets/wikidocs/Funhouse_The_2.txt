A Fun house is an amusement facility found in amusement parks and funfair midways, equipped with various devices designed to surprise, challenge, or amuse visitors. Unlike thrill rides or dark rides, fun houses are participatory attractions where visitors enter and move around at their own pace. Incorporating aspects of a obstacle course, they seek to distort conventional perceptions and startle people with unpredictable physical circumstances.
