A Single Girl (French: La Fille seule) is a 1995 French drama film directed by Benoît Jacquot. It follows a day in the life of a young Parisian woman named Valérie (Virginie Ledoyen) who begins a new job at a four-star hotel the same day she reveals to her boyfriend (Benoît Magimel) that she is pregnant. The 90-minute film is shot in real time, with a very mobile camera style, recalling the French New Wave.
This was the breakthrough role for the 19-year-old Ledoyen (who later became known in the United States for the 2000 film The Beach), and earned her a César Award nomination.
