秋心 Autumn Heart is the ninth studio album of cantopop singer Prudence Liew, released in December 1992.


== Background information ==
The Chinese title of the album is derived from the two characters autumn (秋) and heart (心) that combine to form the portmanteau Chinese character, sorrow (愁).  The hidden meaning of the title is that the album deals with songs of sorrow and woe. The lead single to the album, "舊曲新愁 (Old Song, New Sorrow)" is arranged into two different versions in the album: A Some Version is arranged in a more traditional Chinese way with the inclusion of Yangqin in the music background.  A Heartache Version is more modern with a stronger beat and urban feel to the song.
