Tetsuo II: Body Hammer (鉄男II Body Hammer) is a 1992 Japanese tokusatsu
cyberpunk body horror film directed by Shinya Tsukamoto. It is a bigger-budget sequel to Tsukamoto's 1989 film Tetsuo: The Iron Man, utilizing similar themes and ideas as his first film, and largely the same cast, though the story is not a direct continuation of that of its predecessor. In Body Hammer, a Japanese salary man, played by cult actor Tomorowo Taguchi, finds his body transforming into a weapon through sheer rage after his son is kidnapped by a gang of violent thugs.
Although not as well received as its predecessor, Body Hammer won the Critic's Award at the 3rd Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival in February 1992.
A third installment, entitled The Bullet Man, was released in May 2010.
