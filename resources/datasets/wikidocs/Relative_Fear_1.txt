== Reception ==
In the book Representing Autism: Culture, Narrative, Fascination, Stuart Murray describes the film as "the worst kind of example of the prosthetic narrative, where the idea of disability simply becomes part of a genetic method". He states that there is "little recognizably autistic in anything Adam does"
