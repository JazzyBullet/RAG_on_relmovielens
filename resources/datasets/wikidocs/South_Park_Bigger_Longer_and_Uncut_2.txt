South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut â€“ Music from and Inspired by the Motion Picture is the soundtrack album to the film of the same name. The album was released on June 22, 1999, by Atlantic Records. The album inlay states that only the first 12 tracks on the album actually appear in the film. The remainder, described as being "inspired" by the movie, are mostly other acts performing alternate versions of those songs; however, D.V.D.A.'s "What Would Brian Boitano Do? Pt. II" and Michael McDonald's "Eyes of a Child" are played in the closing credits. The songs were all written by Trey Parker and Marc Shaiman.
