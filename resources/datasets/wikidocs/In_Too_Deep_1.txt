The song features in the movie Mona Lisa during a sequence in which Bob Hoskins's character investigates the sex establishments of Soho.
In the 2000 American psychological thriller film American Psycho, Patrick Bateman (played by Christian Bale) describes the song as "the most moving pop song of the 1980s, about monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. The lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything I've heard in rock."
