Cats Don't Dance is a 1997 American animated musical comedy film directed by Mark Dindal (in his feature directorial debut). The film features the voices of Scott Bakula, Jasmine Guy, Matthew Herried, Ashley Peldon, John Rhys-Davies, Kathy Najimy, Don Knotts, Hal Holbrook, Betty Lou Gerson (in her final film role), Ren√© Auberjonois, Dindal, and George Kennedy.
The film's musical numbers were written by Randy Newman and includes the contributions of Gene Kelly as choreographer, before his death in 1996. The film was Kelly's final film project and is dedicated to his memory. It is the only fully animated feature produced by Turner Feature Animation, which was merged during the post-production of Cats Don't Dance into Warner Bros. Feature Animation after the merger of Time Warner with Turner Broadcasting System in 1996.
Cats Don't Dance was released in the United States on March 26, 1997, by Warner Bros. under its Family Entertainment label. It was a box-office bomb, grossing $3.5 million domestically due to lack of promotion. Despite this, the film received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for its animation, humor, characters, voice performances, and musical numbers, and over the years gained a cult following.
