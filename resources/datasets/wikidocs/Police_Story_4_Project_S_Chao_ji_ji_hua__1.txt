Police Story 3: Supercop (Chinese: 警察故事３超級警察; Cantonese Yale: gíng chaat gu sih sāam: Chīu kāp gíng chaat), released as Supercop in the United States and also known as Jackie Chan's Supercop, is a 1992 Hong Kong action film directed by Stanley Tong. It is the third installment in the Police Story series, with Jackie Chan, Maggie Cheung and Bill Tung reprising their roles from the first two films, and Michelle Yeoh introduced as a new co-lead alongside Chan.
In Supercop, series protagonist Chan Ka-kui (Chan) is selected as Hong Kong's "supercop" to work undercover with elite Chinese policewoman Jessica Yang (Yeoh) and take down a drug cartel. It is the last film in the series to feature Cheung, and the first not directed by Chan, although he returns as action director and is now also a producer.
Chan, Tung and Tong would return for the direct sequel First Strike (1996), which would conclude the original series before two reboots in 2004 and 2013; Yeoh would also receive her own spin-off film Supercop 2 in 1993, again directed by Tong.
