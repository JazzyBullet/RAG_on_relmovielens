Air Bud is a 1997 sports comedy film directed by Charles Martin Smith. An international co-production of the United States and Canada, the film stars Kevin Zegers as a young boy who befriends a runaway Golden Retriever (portrayed by Air Buddy) with a unique ability to play basketball.
Air Bud received mixed reviews but was a commercial success, grossing $4 million in its opening weekend and totaling $27.8 million in its run against an estimated $3 million budget. It was followed by a direct sequel, Air Bud: Golden Receiver, in 1998, and spawned a film franchise that includes the spin-off series Air Buddies.
