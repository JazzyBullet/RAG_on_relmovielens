"Private Idaho" is a single released by the B-52's from their second studio album Wild Planet (1980).


== Composition ==
The B-52's are from Athens, Georgia, and never played a concert in Idaho until September 13, 2011, when they played at Eagle River Pavilion in Eagle, Idaho. In preparation of the event, the Idaho Statesman interviewed Fred Schneider about the song's meaning. "Idaho is pretty mysterious to all of us," he said. "I know it's a beautiful state, but then I know there's also a lot of crazy right-wingers and all that stuff. ...The song's about all different things. It's not like a parody of Idaho or anything."


== Reception ==
Cash Box called it "a contagious rock dancer" with a "rumbling big beat and surf guitar, with alien vocals." Record World called it a "catchy dance-rocker."


== Chart history ==
The single was their second Billboard Hot 100 chart entry, at #74. The single also peaked at #5 on the US Hot Dance Club Play, along with previous single "Give Me Back My Man" and "Party out of Bounds", both from Wild Planet.
"Private Idaho" reached number 11 in Australia. It was the 83rd-biggest Australian hit of 1980.
