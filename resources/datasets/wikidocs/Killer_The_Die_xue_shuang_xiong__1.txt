The Killer (Chinese: 喋血雙雄) is a 1989 Hong Kong action crime film directed by John Woo and stars Chow Yun-fat, Danny Lee and Sally Yeh. In the film, an assassin (Chow) accidentally damages the eyes of a singer (Yeh) during a shootout and sets out to perform one last hit for her treatment.
After the financial backing from Tsui Hark became problematic following the release of A Better Tomorrow 2, Woo had to find backing through Chow Yun-fat's and Danny Lee's financing companies. Woo went into filming The Killer with a rough draft whose plot was influenced by the films Le Samouraï, Mean Streets and Narazumono. Woo wanted to make a film about honour, friendship and the relationship of two seemingly opposite people. After finishing filming, Woo referred to The Killer as a tribute to directors Jean-Pierre Melville and Martin Scorsese.
The Killer was not an immediate success in Hong Kong, but received critical acclaim internationally with reviewers praising its action sequences and over-the-top style. The film became Woo's stepping stone to Hollywood and has been a strong influence on many directors, including Quentin Tarantino, Robert Rodriguez and Johnnie To. In the years since, The Killer has come to be considered one of the greatest action films ever made.
