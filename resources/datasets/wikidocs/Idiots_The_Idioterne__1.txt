The Idiots (Danish: Idioterne) is a 1998 Danish black comedy-drama film written and directed by Lars von Trier. It is his first film made in compliance with the Dogme 95 Manifesto, and is also known as Dogme #2. It is the second film in von Trier's Golden Heart Trilogy, preceded by Breaking the Waves (1996) and succeeded by Dancer in the Dark (2000). It is among the first films to be shot entirely with digital cameras.
It was screened at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for the Palme dâ€™Or, despite being met with widespread criticism upon release.
