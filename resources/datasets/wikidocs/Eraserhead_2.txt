Eraserheads (sometimes stylized as ERASƎRHEADS or ƎRASƎRHƎADS) are a Filipino alternative rock band formed in 1989. With a lineup comprising Ely Buendia, Buddy Zabala, Marcus Adoro, and Raimund Marasigan, they are the most influential and successful Filipino band in Philippine music history. Regarded as "the Beatles of the Philippines", the band have sold 9 million copies of their discography throughout their career.
With their debut album Ultraelectromagneticpop! (1993) and the following albums Circus (1994) and Cutterpillow (1995), Eraserheads ushered in a second wave of Filipino rock bands in the 1990s.  Their first three albums also achieved commercial success, with Cutterpillow becoming the third biggest-selling album in OPM history and the biggest for any Filipino band or group. Eraserheads also received the International Viewer’s Choice Award (MTV Asia) at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards in New York, the only Filipino artist to have received the award before the conception of the MTV Asia Awards.
After releasing the Christmas-themed concept album Fruitcake (1996), Eraserheads experimented with electronic and art rock styles for their next albums Sticker Happy (1997), Natin99 (1999), and Carbon Stereoxide (2001). The band broke up in 2002, and all principal former members have enjoyed success as solo artists. They later reunited in 2008 for a series of reunion concerts in the Philippines and have since made sporadic touring and promotional appearances in the country and overseas.
