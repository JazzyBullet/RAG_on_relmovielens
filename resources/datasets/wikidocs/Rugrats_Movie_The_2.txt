Rugrats in Paris: The Movie is a 2000 animated comedy film based on the Nickelodeon animated television series Rugrats. It is the second installment in the Rugrats film series and the sequel to  The Rugrats Movie (1998). This film marks the first appearance of Kimi Watanabe and her mother, Kira. The film also marks the appearance of the first significant villains in the Rugrats franchise, the child-hating Coco LaBouche and her accomplice, Jean-Claude. The events of the film take place before the series' seventh season.
The film was released in the United States on November 17, 2000, almost two years after the release of the first film. Rugrats in Paris was more well-received than its predecessor and grossed over $103 million worldwide against a production budget of $30 million. This was the final Rugrats film to feature Christine Cavanaugh as the voice of Chuckie, who retired from being a full-time voice actor in 2001 and died in 2014. A sequel, and a crossover with characters from The Wild Thornberrys franchise titled Rugrats Go Wild, was released on June 13, 2003.
