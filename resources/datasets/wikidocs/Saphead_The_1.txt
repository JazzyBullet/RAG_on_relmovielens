The Saphead is a 1920 American comedy-drama film featuring Buster Keaton.It was the actor's first starring role in a full-length feature and the film that launched his career as a leading man. Keaton was cast on the recommendation of Douglas Fairbanks.
The plot was a merging of two stories, Bronson Howard's 1887 play The Henrietta and the 1913 play based on Howard's comedy, The New Henrietta by Victor Mapes and Winchell Smith, which was meant to be an adaption of Howard's play.
