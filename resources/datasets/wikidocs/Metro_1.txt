The Rome Metro (Italian: Metropolitana di Roma) is a rapid transit system that operates in Rome, Italy. It started operation in 1955, making it the oldest in the country.
The Metro comprises three lines – A (orange), B (blue) and C (green) – which operate on 60 km (37 mi) of route, serving 73 stations. It has a daily ridership of approximately 820 thousand passengers, and an annual traffic of approximately 320 million passengers.
In addition to the Metro, the center of Rome and its urban area are served by 8 FL lines (672 km (417.5 mi) with 131 stations) that surround Rome and the Lazio region,  6 tram lines (36 km (22 mi) ) with 192 stations), 3 commuter urban lines (135 km (83.8 mi) with 57 stations), as well as the Leonardo Express which connects Roma Termini, the central station of the city of Rome, to the Leonardo da Vinci Airport of Fiumicino, and the Civitavecchia Express which connects the city to the main port of Rome, the Port of Civitavecchia. Network extensions are currently under construction on Line C (Porta Metronia, Colosseo-Fori Imperiali and Venezia). There are further projects for Line A, Line B, Rome-Giardinetti and for the suburban rail system. The entire transport system in Rome uses the Metrebus integrated tariff system (an acronym composed of the words "Metro", "Train" and "Bus"), which can be used within the limits of the Municipality of Rome and within the limits of the urban tariff.
Despite the letter identifying it, line B was the first metro line inaugurated in the system, as well as the first official metro in Italy. Inaugurated in post-war Italy in 1955 during the reconstruction and on the verge of the Italian economic miracle, it was designed and built for the 1942 universal exhibition (Esposizione Universale Roma, which is now the current business center of Rome) desired by the fascist regime, which never took place due to the outbreak of the World War II.
