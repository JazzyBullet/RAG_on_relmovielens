== Background ==
The film was created with a budget of $1.6 million. It was co-produced by Peggy Thompson and Sharon McGowan.
The film takes its name from a lyric in Sarah McLachlan's song "Ice Cream", "Your love is better than chocolate". Veena Sood, the sister of McLachlan's then-husband Ashwin Sood, has a small role in the film as a religious protester.
The plot line about the bookstore is a fairly direct reference to Vancouver's Little Sister's Book and Art Emporium and its travails with Canada Customs.  The bookstore is thanked in the credits. Ann-Marie MacDonald, who plays the bookstore's owner, is a well-known Canadian author.
The movie poster, which shows two women embracing and one woman's naked back, was banned by the Hong Kong Television and Entertainment Licensing Authority as it was deemed "offensive to public morality, decency and ordinary good taste."  An advertisement in the San Diego Union-Tribune was also removed, due to the word "lesbian" being present on the movie poster.


== Soundtrack ==
The soundtrack of the film was released as a CD in 1999 on Lakeshore Records.
