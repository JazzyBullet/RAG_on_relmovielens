== Gameplay ==
There are eight side-scrolling platform levels in Elmo in Grouchland, and each one is very short. The player generally spends each level hopping over obstacles such as fire hydrants. Along with the eight platforming levels are two alternate style levels, each one different. In one, the player is sitting in a minecart and has to duck the low ceilings as the mine cart moves forward. The other involves Elmo falling into Grouchland. The player moves Elmo left and right, helping him to avoid trash.
