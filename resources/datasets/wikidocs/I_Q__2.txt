.iq is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Iraq.
This domain was in limbo for several years, as the delegated manager was imprisoned in Texas on charges of alleged connections to Hamas (a State Department designated terrorist organization), for which he was later convicted in 2005. Some talk of redelegation and relaunching began taking place at the time of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and in 2005 a redelegation to the National Communications and Media Commission of Iraq was approved by ICANN.
