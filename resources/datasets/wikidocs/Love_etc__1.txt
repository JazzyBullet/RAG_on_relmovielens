"Love Etc." is a song by English synth-pop duo Pet Shop Boys from their tenth studio album, Yes (2009). It was released on 16 March 2009 as the album's lead single. The single was also made available on the US and Canadian iTunes Stores on 24 March 2009, making it the duo's first single to be released in the US, albeit as a digital download, since "Break 4 Love" in 2001.
The song was co-written by Pet Shop Boys with production team Xenomania, who also produced the track. Pet Shop Boys describe "Love Etc." as "a post-lifestyle anthem which sounds like nothing we've done before." The single became the duo's ninth number-one entry on the Hot Dance Club Songs chart; the pair thus overtook Depeche Mode to break the record for the most chart-toppers by a duo or group on the Billboard dance chart.
The music video was directed by Dutch digital artist Han Hoogerbrugge. The website Stereogum described it as a "horizontally scrolling animated video [that] is part Sonic The Hedgehog (dated video game reference!) and part Pac Man (chomping down on hearts, shamrocks, and cash money), with a lineup of Chrisses, Neils, and others shouting, flexing, unmasking, and turning into draculas."
