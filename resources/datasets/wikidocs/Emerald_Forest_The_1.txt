The Emerald Forest is a 1985 British adventure drama film set in the Brazilian rainforest, directed by John Boorman, written by Rospo Pallenberg, and starring Powers Boothe, Meg Foster, and Charley Boorman with supporting roles by Rui Polanah, Tetchie Agbayani, Dira Paes, Estee Chandler, and Eduardo Conde.
The film tells the story of an American boy who is kidnapped by an indigenous tribe in the Amazon jungle. It is allegedly based on a true story, although the accuracy of this claim has been disputed. The film was screened out of competition at the 1985 Cannes Film Festival, where it was chosen as the closing film. In promoting the film for awards competition, Boorman created the first Oscar screeners, but the film received no Academy Award nominations.
