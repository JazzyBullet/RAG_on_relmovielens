In the context of combinatorial mathematics, stars and bars (also called "sticks and stones", "balls and bars", and "dots and dividers") is a graphical aid for deriving certain combinatorial theorems. It can be used to solve many simple counting problems, such as how many ways there are to put n indistinguishable balls into k distinguishable bins.


== Statements of theorems ==
The stars and bars method is often introduced specifically to prove the following two theorems of elementary combinatorics concerning the number of solutions to an equation.


=== Theorem one ===
For any pair of positive integers n and k, the number of k-tuples of positive integers whose sum is n is equal to the number of (k − 1)-element subsets of a set with n − 1 elements.
For example, if n = 10 and k = 4, the theorem gives the number of solutions to x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 10 (with x1, x2, x3, x4 > 0) as the binomial coefficient

  
    
      
        
          
            
              (
            
            
              
                n
                −
                1
              
              
                k
                −
                1
              
            
            
              )
            
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              (
            
            
              
                10
                −
                1
              
              
                4
                −
                1
              
            
            
              )
            
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              (
            
            
              9
              3
            
            
              )
            
          
        
        =
        84.
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\binom {n-1}{k-1}}={\binom {10-1}{4-1}}={\binom {9}{3}}=84.}
  

This corresponds to compositions of an integer.


=== Theorem two ===
For any pair of positive integers n and k, the number of k-tuples of non-negative integers whose sum is n is equal to the number of multisets of cardinality n taken from a set of size k, or equivalently, the number of multisets of cardinality k − 1 taken from a set of size n + 1.
For example, if n = 10 and k = 4, the theorem gives the number of solutions to x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 10 (with x1, x2, x3, x4
