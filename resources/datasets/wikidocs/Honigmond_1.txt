Welle:Erdball (often abbreviated as W:E) is a German band whose sound is distinguished by their intensive use of the Commodore 64's SID sound chip.
The band name literally means "Wave:Earthball" or "Wave:Globe" and is inspired by a Weimar republican radio play titled "Hallo! Hier Welle Erdball!". The band's logo displays a rotated version of the Eastern German motor company VEB Sachsenring, the former producer the world-famous Trabant car.
Welle:Erdball have been part of the demoscene and produced several musicdisks as well as other formats over the years. They have also performed live at the Breakpoint 2006.
In addition to his work as Welle:Erdball, Honey was involved in the project called "Das Pr√§parat" from 2003 to 2005. Honey (a.k.a. Dr. Georg Linde) and "Plastique" have launched a side project called "homo~futura".
