Cléo from 5 to 7 (French: Cléo de 5 à 7 [kle.o də sɛ̃k a sɛt]) is a 1962 French New Wave drama film written and directed by Agnès Varda.
The film follows Florence, a young singer known professionally as "Cléo Victoire", from 5 p.m. until 6:30 p.m. on June 21, as she waits to hear the results of a biopsy that will possibly confirm a diagnosis of stomach cancer. 
The film includes cameos by Jean-Luc Godard, Anna Karina, Eddie Constantine, and Jean-Claude Brialy as characters in a silent film, while composer Michel Legrand, who wrote the film's score, plays Bob, the pianist. It was entered into the 1962 Cannes Film Festival.
