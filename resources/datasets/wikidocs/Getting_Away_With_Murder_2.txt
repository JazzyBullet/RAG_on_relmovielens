Getting Away with Murder is the fourth and third major-label studio album by the American rock band Papa Roach. The album was a departure from the band's previous works, showcasing an alternative rock and hard rock sound instead of a nu metal and rap metal sound. Unlike their previous albums, the album features no rapping and instead only features Jacoby Shaddix singing. It was released on August 31, 2004, via Geffen Records and has been certified Gold in Canada, Silver in the United Kingdom and Platinum in the United States. Getting Away with Murder peaked at number 17 on the Billboard 200.


== Background ==
Production lasted from October to December 2003. During the recording of Getting Away With Murder, the band was not signed to a label as their previous label DreamWorks Records had recently been bought out. The band would later sign to Geffen Records. The album features a departure from the band's rap metal sound, as the band's vocalist Jacoby Shaddix was tired of rapping.
The track "Just Go (Never Look Back)" was recorded in the album's sessions, but was ultimately left off the album. The track would later be released on the band's future greatest hits album, ...To Be Loved: The Best of Papa Roach.

The second single, "Scars", peaked at number four on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart,  number two on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100, and number seven on the Pop Songs chart, becoming the band's biggest hit in the United States. "Scars" was ranked at number 36 as the greatest song of 2005 and as the most successful song of the year by Billboard, becoming the band's first and only song to be included on Billboard's year-end charts, in addition, "Scars" was the band's first song to crossover to top 40 radio since their breakthrough hit, "Last Resort". The song "Take Me" also charted on the Alternative songs chart (at number 23), and on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart (at number 11) despite not being released as a single. To support the album, the band toured throughout 2004 and 2005.
