William J. Butcher, or "Billy the Butcher", is an antihero in the comic book and Amazon Prime series The Boys, created by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson. He is the leader of The Boys, a group of CIA-sponsored vigilantes (consisting of Wee Hughie, Mother's Milk, Frenchie, and the Female) who observe, record and sometimes liquidate "Supes" (i.e. "superpowered" or "superhuman" individuals, often acting as "superheroes") artificially created by the mega-conglomerate Vought. He is the Homelander's archenemy, whom he blames for the rape and death of his wife Becky, while also developing an intense hatred for all superhuman beings.
Butcher is portrayed by Karl Urban in the Amazon Prime Video streaming adaptation, and voiced by Jason Isaacs and Kay Eluvian in animation.
