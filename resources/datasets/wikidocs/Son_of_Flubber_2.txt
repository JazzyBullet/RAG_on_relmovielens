The Flubber (also known as The Absent-Minded Professor) franchise consists of American science-fiction-comedy films, with three theatrical releases, and two made-for-television films. The overall story is based on the short story, A Situation of Gravity, written by Samuel W. Taylor in 1943. The plot of the films center around an absent-minded college professor (with differing names and played by various actors depending on the adaptation), who works tirelessly to find the next great invention. The Professor wants to make scientific history, while working to save the school at which he works, the Medfield College.
The two original films, starring Fred MacMurray, were financially and critically well-received. Years later during the '80s, a made-for-television remake was released as a part of The Magical World of Disney series, with a sequel that followed soon thereafter. By 1997, a theatrical remake, with the story adjusted for then-modern time, was developed with Robin Williams in the starring role.
Though each film was a financial success, not all were critical successes. Critics called the remake "a total dud", while others noted that the studio's attempt at relaunching the franchise resulted in "a cute, well-meaning, but ultimately disappointing movie". Several critics noted the film's overuse of slapstick comedy. In 1999 the Flubber films, along with a number of other Disney film series, were expanded as a franchise into the Walt Disney Parks attraction with elements included from each film.
