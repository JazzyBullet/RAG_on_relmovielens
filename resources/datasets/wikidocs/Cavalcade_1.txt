A cavalcade is a procession or parade on horseback, or a mass distance ride by a company of riders.  
Sometimes the focus of a cavalcade is participation rather than display and the participants do not wear costumes or ride in formation. Sometimes, a modern cavalcade re-enacts an important historical event and follows a long-distance trail.  A cavalcade may also be a pilgrimage.
