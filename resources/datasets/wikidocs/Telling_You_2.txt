== Reception ==
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 20% based on reviews from 5 critics.
Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club called it "really boring in an extremely earnest fashion." Rabin warned that it "is not, as its box would somewhat dishonestly indicate, a Jennifer Love Hewitt vehicle. It is, instead, a laughless, irritatingly earnest comedy-drama about ..." the characters played by Mihok and Facinelli. Rabin said Hewitt and Lillard have little more than cameos but credits Lillard for giving the film what little spark it has.
Kathleen Craughwell of The L.A. Times said it "is pleasant enough and the production values are as good as any studio film. But the characters and what happens to them...just aren't as interesting as these actors, and their audience, deserve."
