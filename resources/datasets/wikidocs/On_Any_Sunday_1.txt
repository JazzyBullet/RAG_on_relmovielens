On Any Sunday is a 1971 American documentary film about motorcycle sport, directed by Bruce Brown. It was nominated for a 1972 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. Brown tried to show the unique talents needed for the different forms of racing. For instance, the motocross riders were typically free-spirited types, while desert racers were often loners. In Grand National racing, Brown showed widely differing personalities, such as the business-like approach to racing displayed by Mert Lawwill versus the carefree approach that David Aldana became known for.
In addition to Lawwill, Steve McQueen is featured in the film, along with Malcolm Smith and many other motorcycle racers from the late 1960s and early 1970s.  Many of the uncredited riders include Brad lackey, Ed Rhode, Sylvain Geboers,Torleif Hansen, John Banks, Gary Jones.
Motorcycle brands featured in the film include Triumph, Montesa, Husqvarna, Harley-Davidson, Honda, Yamaha, Suzuki, BSA, CZ, Bultaco, and Hodaka.
