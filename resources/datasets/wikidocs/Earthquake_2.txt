Earthquakes are caused by movements within the Earth's crust and uppermost mantle. They range from weak events detectable only by seismometers, to sudden and violent events lasting many minutes which have caused some of the greatest disasters in human history. Below, earthquakes are listed by period, region or country, year, magnitude, cost, fatalities and number of scientific studies.

46 earthquakes with an estimated magnitude of 8.5 or higher have occurred since 1800 BCE. For those which occurred before the development and deployment of seismographs – starting around 1900 – magnitudes are estimated from historical reports of the extent and severity of damage.

Historical records are known to be incomplete. Earthquakes that occurred in remote areas prior to the advent of modern instrumentation in the early to mid 1900s were not well-reported, and exact locations and magnitudes of such events are often unknown. Therefore, the apparent increase in large earthquake frequency over the last few centuries is unlikely to be accurate, with the better interpretation that, had the list been more complete, then a dozen or so per century would be average.


== Largest earthquakes by country/territory ==
This list is a work in progress. Information is likely to be changed.
The list refers to current country boundaries rather than those at the date of the earthquake.
Please note, multiple countries could have the same earthquake listed, such as the 1906 Ecuador–Colombia earthquake being listed for both Ecuador and Colombia.
Unless otherwise noted, magnitudes are reported on the Moment magnitude scale (Mw).


== Costliest earthquakes ==

This is the top ten major earthquakes by the dollar value of property (public and private) losses directly attributable to the earthquake.


== Deadliest earthquakes ==

The following is a summary list of earthquakes with over approximately 100,000 deaths:


== Most studied earthquakes ==
The 50 most studied earthquakes according to the International Seismological Centre (ISC), based on a count of scientific papers (mostly in English) that discuss that earthquake. The "Event #" is linked to the ISC Event Bibliography for that event.
