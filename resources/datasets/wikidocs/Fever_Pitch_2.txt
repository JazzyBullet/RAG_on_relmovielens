Fever Pitch (released as The Perfect Catch outside North America) is a 2005 American romantic comedy-drama film directed by the Farrelly brothers. It stars Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon and is a remake of the British 1997 film of the same title. Nick Hornby, who had written the original 1992 book and the 1997 screenplay adaptation, acted as an executive producer for the American remake.
While both the book and the original 1997 film are about soccer, the 2005 adaptation, aimed specifically at the U.S. market, is about baseball. Both Fever Pitch films feature real-life dramatic sporting victories, the original focusing on Arsenal's last minute League title win in the final game of the 1988â€“1989 season, and the remake on the Boston Red Sox's World Series Championship in 2004, unanticipated while the film was in production.
The film was released on April 8, 2005, in the United States, with Inside the CIA, a promotional short film for American Dad!, premiering with it. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $50 million.
