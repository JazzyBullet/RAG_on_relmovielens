"Beautiful Girls" is the debut single by American reggae-influenced musician Sean Kingston from his 2007 eponymous debut album; it was first released in 2007, when Kingston was 17. The song samples the 1961 song "Stand by Me" by American singer-songwriter Ben E. King. The song is about a boy who feels "suicidal" (or "in denial" in the edited version) over the prospect of dating a "beautiful girl". It is Kingston's signature song.
Rapper Lil Mama and actors Kenny Vibert and Lil' JJ are featured in the music video directed by Marcus Raboy, which hit 1 billion YouTube views on September 8, 2022.
