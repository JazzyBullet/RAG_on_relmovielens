The film also stars Paulette Goddard, Henry Bergman, Tiny Sandford and Chester Conklin.
Modern Times has won many awards and honors, and is widely considered one of the greatest films ever. It was one of the first 25 films selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry for being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".
