The following is a list of characters appearing in Disney's Aladdin franchise. It includes characters from the 1992 film, its direct-to-video sequels, its television series, its live-action adaptation, and other spin-off projects.


== Appearing in Aladdin ==


=== Aladdin ===

Aladdin (speaking voice by Scott Weinger, singing voice by Brad Kane, portrayed by Mena Massoud in the live-action film) is a street urchin who ends up becoming the prince of Agrabah after meeting Jasmine in the streets and being recruited by Jafar to retrieve the magical lamp from the Cave of Wonders.
In the 2019 film, Aladdin is mentioned to have lost his parents when asked about them by Jasmine using the alias of Dalia.


=== Princess Jasmine ===

Jasmine (voiced by Linda Larkin, singing voice Lea Salonga, portrayed by Naomi Scott in the live-action film) is the rebellious princess of Agrabah, who flees the palace in revolt to her obligation to be married to a prince. While on the run, she meets Aladdin in the streets and later helps him defeat Jafar.
In the 2019 film, Jasmine is served by a handmaiden named Dalia.


=== Genie ===

Genie (voiced by Robin Williams in the first and third film, Dan Castellaneta in the second film, TV series, and Kingdom Hearts, Jim Meskimen in later projects, portrayed by Will Smith in the live-action film) is a jinn and is never given a proper name.
Following a contract dispute between Williams and the Walt Disney Company, Dan Castellaneta voiced the Genie in The Return of Jafar, as well as the television series, before Williams reprised the role for the final installment Aladdin and the King of Thieves, as well as for the character's own mini-series, Great Minds Think for Themselves. Jim Meskimen took over the role in Disney Think Fast (2008) and Kinect: Disneyland Adventures (2011) and currently voices him after Williams' death in 2014.
In the 2019 film, the Genie is shown to have his usual blue form and his human disguise. He does fall in love with Dalia.
After Williams' death in 2014, a dedicated drawing of the Genie appeared at the end of the first film on television programs.


=== Jafar ===

As Royal Vizier of Agrabah, Jafar (voiced by Jonathan Freeman, portrayed by Marwan Kenzari in the live-action film) was presented as the Sultan's most trusted and loyal advisor. Imperious, Jafar held passionate disdain for the Sultan, and dedicated the latter half of his life to gaining ownership of a magic lamp containing an all-powerful genieâ€”to that end, he would control cosmic power, to which he would use to overtake the Sultanate and the world at large. Jafar is also the main antagonist of the film.
In the 2019 film, Jafar is depicted as a former thief, motivated by revenge against the kingdom's neighboring ally Shirabad, homeland of the Sultan's wife and Jasmine's late mother.


=== Iago ===

Iago (voiced by Gilbert Gottfried, Alan Tudyk in the live-action film) is the pet and former sidekick to Jafar, and later to Aladdin, after a reformation. He is comical and sarcastic, and appears as a sort of cantankerous counterpart to Aladdin's monkey, Abu.
Iago appears frequently as an antagonist in the Sega video game Disney's Aladdin, where he is usually to be found flying at a high level, although he is easily dispatched and de-feathered with one blow from a sabre or thrown apple.
In the 2019 film, Iago mostly talks like a parrot at different parts.


=== Abu ===

Abu (vocal effects provided by Frank Welker) is Aladdin's kleptomaniac pet monkey with a high-pitched voice. In Aladdin: The Series, he is a voice of dissent whenever he is dragged along on one of Iago's harebrained schemes, although the two of them go from enemies (formerly) to close friends after Iago's reformation, over the course of the franchise. The animators filmed monkeys at the San Francisco Zoo to study the movements Abu would have. The character is based on the similarly named Abu the thief, played by Sabu Dastagir in the 1940 version of The Thief of Bag
