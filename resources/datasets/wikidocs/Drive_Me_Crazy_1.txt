Drive Me Crazy is a 1999 American teen romantic comedy film based on the novel How I Created My Perfect Prom Date by Todd Strasser. Originally entitled Next to You, the film's title was changed to Drive Me Crazy after one of the songs from its soundtrack, "(You Drive Me) Crazy" by Britney Spears. The film, despite mixed-to-negative reviews, with criticism aimed at its unoriginal plot, grossed $22.6 worldwide, against an $8 million budget, making it a moderate box office success. The soundtrack featured The Donnas, who also appeared in the film.
