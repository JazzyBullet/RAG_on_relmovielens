Patch Adams is a 1998 American biographical comedy-drama film directed by Tom Shadyac and starring Robin Williams (in the title role), Monica Potter, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Bob Gunton, Daniel London and Peter Coyote. Set in the late 1960s and early 1970s, it is loosely based on the life story of Dr. Hunter "Patch" Adams and the book Gesundheit: Good Health Is a Laughing Matter by Dr. Adams and Maureen Mylander. The film received generally unfavorable reviews from critics, with criticism for the sentimentality and direction, but was a box-office success and grossed $202.3 million against a $50â€“90 million budget.
