Amityville II: The Possession is a 1982 supernatural horror film directed by Damiano Damiani and starring James Olson, Burt Young, Rutanya Alda, Jack Magner, and Diane Franklin. The screenplay by Tommy Lee Wallace is based on the novel Murder in Amityville by the parapsychologist Hans Holzer. It is the second film in the Amityville Horror film series and a loose prequel to The Amityville Horror (1979), set at 112 Ocean Avenue and featuring the fictional Montelli family, loosely based on the DeFeo family. It follows the Montelli family's decline under apparent demonic forces present in their home.
A co-production between the United States and Mexico, principal photography took place at the same Toms River, New Jersey residence featured in the first film, while interiors were shot exclusively on soundstages at Estudios Churubusco in Mexico City. After test screenings were completed, Damiani's original cut of the film was slightly truncated to tone down its overt incestuous sexuality and a rape sequence, which audiences responded to unfavorably.
Released by Orion Pictures in the fall of 1982, Amityville II: The Possession received mixed reviews from critics, though some, such as Roger Ebert, felt it was superior to its predecessor, an opinion that has been echoed by contemporary reviewers.
