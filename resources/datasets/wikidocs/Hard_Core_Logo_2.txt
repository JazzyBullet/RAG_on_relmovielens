A Tribute to Hard Core Logo is a 1996 album, which was released as an unofficial soundtrack to Bruce McDonald's film Hard Core Logo.
The film is a mockumentary about the reunion tour of a Canadian punk rock band, Hard Core Logo. Instead of releasing a conventional soundtrack, McDonald compiled a tribute album, asking a number of notable Canadian and international bands to record cover versions of the film's songs. The album was packaged with the participating musicians contributing quotes about Hard Core Logo's "influence" on their own music.
As part of the promotion for the album and film, McDonald placed classified ads in many Canadian publications, purporting to be from fans looking to buy Hard Core Logo memorabilia. Some real fans actually looking to purchase real promotional materials, such as movie posters or rare vinyl copies of the album, were forced to append comments in their advertisements to clarify that their ads were real.
The music video for "Blue Tattoo" by The Super Friendz appears on the Canadian VHS of the film.
A true soundtrack album, Hard Core Logo, was subsequently released in 1998 featuring the original songs as performed by Hugh Dillon with the band Swamp Baby.
