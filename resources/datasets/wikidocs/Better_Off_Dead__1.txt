Better Off Dead is a 1985 American black comedy film written and directed by Savage Steve Holland. It stars John Cusack as high school student Lane Meyer, who becomes suicidal after his girlfriend breaks up with him shortly before Christmas.
Initially met with mixed to negative reviews on release, it has since developed a cult following for its unconventionally surreal and absurdist humor.
