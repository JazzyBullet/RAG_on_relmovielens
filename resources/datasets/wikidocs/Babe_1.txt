Their highest single ranking on the Oricon charts was #4 in 1987 for Somebody Loves You. They sang "Get A Chance!" as the end theme and post-credits music video in the third Project A-ko anime and the television adaptation of Hana no Asuka-gumi!. They also sang an all English song, "Love in the First Degree" (a cover of the Bananarama single).
They disbanded in February 1990 because of Yukari's marriage and pregnancy.
