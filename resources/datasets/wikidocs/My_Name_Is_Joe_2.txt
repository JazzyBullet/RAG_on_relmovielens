AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine rated the album four out of five stars and noted that "there may not be much variety or many remarkable songs on the record [...] but that doesn't matter because this is essentially a mood record, and that mood is love. And it's not a bad romantic mood-setter, either, since Joe is an appealing vocalist, the production is lush without being syrupy, and the songs are all fairly strong, even if only a handful are exceptional."
Billboard critic Michael Paoletta noted that "with production guidance from the one-named singer himself, Tim & Bob, Teddy Riley, She'kspere, and others, Joe smoothly steers from sweet submission to love and honor [...] Joe plants a firmer grip on R&B's passionate romance torch." Matt Diehl from Entertainment Weekly found that Joe's "horny histrionics lack authentic bump or grind. A pleasant enough singer with a high, flowery voice, Joe comes off like Babyface meets Al B. Sure! [...] His come-ons might go over better if supported by something other than boilerplate pop-soul production. Joe’s best when his wispy vocals are contrasted."
