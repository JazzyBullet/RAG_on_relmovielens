Enclosed Alphanumeric Supplement is a Unicode block consisting of Latin alphabet characters and Arabic numerals enclosed in circles, ovals or boxes, used for a variety of purposes. It is encoded in the range U+1F100â€“U+1F1FF in the Supplementary Multilingual Plane.
The block is mostly an extension of the Enclosed Alphanumerics block, containing further enclosed alphanumeric characters which are not included in that block or Enclosed CJK Letters and Months. Most of the characters are single alphanumerics in boxes or circles, or with trailing commas. Two of the symbols are identified as dingbats. A number of multiple-letter enclosed abbreviations are also included, mostly to provide compatibility with Broadcast Markup Language standards (see ARIB STD B24 character set) and Japanese telecommunications networks' emoji sets. The block also includes the regional indicator symbols to be used for emoji country flag support.
