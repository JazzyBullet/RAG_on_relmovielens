The Broken Arrow murders, also known as the Broken Arrow killings or the Bever Family Massacre, took place on July 22, 2015, when five members of the Bever family were murdered in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, United States.  It was the deadliest crime and mass murder in the city of Broken Arrow.
Daniel Bever (age 12) called 9-1-1, saving the lives of his sisters Autumn (2) and Crystal (13) by alerting authorities. Crystal, one of the two survivors, identified two of her older brothers, 18-year-old Robert and 16-year-old Michael, as the assailants. The brothers were subsequently arrested and charged with five counts of first-degree murder and one count of assault and battery with intent to murder. The perpetrators were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.
