Twenty Four Seven is a 1997 British sports drama film directed and written by Shane Meadows. It was co-written by frequent Meadows collaborator Paul Fraser.


== Plot ==
In a typical English working-class town, the juveniles have nothing more to do than hang around in gangs. Alan Darcy (Bob Hoskins), a highly motivated man with the same kind of youth experience, tries to get the young people off the street and into doing something they can believe in, boxing. He opens a training facility which is accepted gratefully by them and the gangs merge together into a group of friends. Darcy organises a public fight for them to prove what they have learned. A training camp with hiking tours into the mountains of Wales forges the group into a tightly knit club society. With the day of the fight drawing closer, the young boxers get more and more excited.
