Kitchen Nightmares, known in the U.K. as Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares USA, is an American reality television series originally broadcast on Fox, in which chef Gordon Ramsay is invited by the owners to spend a week with a failing restaurant in an attempt to revive the business. Produced by ITV Studios America, it is based on the British show Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares.
The show premiered September 19, 2007, on Fox. On June 23, 2014, Ramsay announced that he was ending the series; the final episode aired on September 12 that year. In June 2018, Gordon Ramsay's 24 Hours to Hell and Back, a new series with a premise much like Kitchen Nightmares but a shorter timeline, premiered on Fox. The show still hosts a YouTube channel with over 6.57 million subscribers. The channel presents highlights from the show, and has also shown selected full episodes of the show. In May 2023, Fox announced that the show would re-enter production for an eighth season, which premiered on September 25, 2023.
