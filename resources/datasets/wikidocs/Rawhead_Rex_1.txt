Rawhead Rex is a 1986 British fantasy horror film directed by George Pavlou from a screenplay by Clive Barker, based on his short story of the same name. The story had originally appeared in Vol. 3 of his Books of Blood series. It stars David Dukes, Kelly Piper, Niall Tóibín, Cora Venus Lunny and Donal McCann.
The film focuses on a monstrous pagan deity's bloody rampage through the Irish countryside, with the title alluding to the folklore monster Rawhead. Pavlou and Barker had previously worked together on Transmutations (also known as Underworld).
The film was given a limited release in the United States by Empire Pictures on 17 April 1987.
