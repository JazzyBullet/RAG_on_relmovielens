"Hellhound on My Trail" (originally "Hell Hound on My Trail") is a blues song recorded by Mississippi Delta bluesman Robert Johnson in June 1937 and released as a 78 rpm single on Vocalion Records that September.  It was inspired by earlier blues songs and blues historian Ted Gioia describes it as one of Johnson's "best known and most admired performancesâ€”many would say it is his greatest".
