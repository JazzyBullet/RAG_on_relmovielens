Poltergeist II: The Other Side (also known simply as Poltergeist II) is a 1986 American supernatural horror film directed by Brian Gibson. JoBeth Williams, Craig T. Nelson, Oliver Robins, Heather O'Rourke and Zelda Rubinstein reprised their roles from the first film. New cast members include Will Sampson, Julian Beck and Geraldine Fitzgerald. The second entry in the Poltergeist film series and a direct sequel to Poltergeist (1982), it follows the Freeling family who again finds themselves under attack from the supernatural forces led by "the Beast", revealed to be the spirit of an insane preacher who led an apocalyptic cult during the 19th century, attempting to claim their daughter. In their efforts to save their daughter, the family finds help in a Native American shaman.
Neither director Tobe Hooper nor producer Steven Spielberg returned for this film. Michael Grais and Mark Victor, who co-wrote the previous film with Spielberg, served as writer and producer here. Filming of Poltergeist II took place in California and Arizona in the spring of 1985. Most of the original cast members returned with the exception of Dominique Dunne, who was murdered shortly after the first film's release in 1982. The film marked the final appearance of Julian Beck, who died on September 14, 1985, as well as the last to be released during Heather O'Rourke's lifetime before her death in February 1988 just four months before her final appearance in the third Poltergeist film, Poltergeist III which was released in June that year. Surrealist artist H. R. Giger designed the creatures featured in the film.
Released in the spring of 1986, Poltergeist II: The Other Side was a financial success, earning nearly $75 million worldwide. Critical reviews were negative, but the film nevertheless followed its predecessor with a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, as well as two Saturn Awards.
