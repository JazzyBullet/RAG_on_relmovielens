I'm Not Rappaport is a 1996 American buddy comedy-drama film written and directed by Herb Gardner, starring Walter Matthau and Ossie Davis. Based on Gardner's play of the same name, the film focuses on two elderly New York City men – Nat Moyer, a cantankerous left-wing Jew, and Midge Carter, an African-American man – who spend their days sitting on a bench in Central Park, trying to mask the realities of aging, mainly through the tall tales that Nat spins.
The film touches on several issues, including society's treatment of the aged, the difficulties dealing with adult children who think they know what's best for their parents, and the dangers that lurk in urban areas. Its title comes from an old vaudeville joke, a variation of which evolved into dialogue between the two protagonists.
