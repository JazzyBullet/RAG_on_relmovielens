Francis Bergeade, owner of a toilet seats and brushes factory in Dole, has just turned 65 and his life is a misery.

During his convalescence, his family watch a reality television show about long-lost relationships and disappearances called Où es-tu? (Where are you?) featuring Spanish-born Dolorès Thivart and her daughters "Zig" and "Puce", producers of foie gras from Condom, who seek their husband and father, Michel, who vanished 27 years ago.
