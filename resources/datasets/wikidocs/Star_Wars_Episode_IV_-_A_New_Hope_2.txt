The Star Wars opening crawl is a signature device of the opening sequences of every numbered film of the Star Wars series, an American epic space opera franchise created by George Lucas. Within a black sky background featuring a smattering of stars, the crawl is preceded both by the opening static blue text, "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...." and by the Star Wars logo which recedes toward a central point on the screen before disappearing.  The crawl text, which describes the backstory and context of the film, then recedes toward a higher point in relation to the screen and with an apparent effect of disappearing in the distance. The visuals are accompanied by the "Main Title Theme", composed by John Williams.
This sequence has featured at the beginning of each of the main Star Wars saga theatrical films produced by Lucasfilm. Although it has retained the same basic elements, the opening crawl has significantly evolved throughout the series. It is one of the most immediately recognizable elements of the franchise and has been frequently parodied.
The opening crawl was not used in the animated film  Star Wars: The Clone Wars or in the Star Wars "Anthology" films, Rogue One and  Solo, although all three films begin with the opening text. Additionally, the opening sequence of Solo continues with a short backstory presented in the same style as the opening text, while The Clone Wars uses a narrator to provide exposition in a similar style to a newsreel. Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy indicated in an April 2023 Entertainment Weekly interview that "the crawl's coming back" when asked if it would return for the upcoming movie focused on Rey. When asked if it would only be back for the Rey movie, Kennedy stated "No. The crawl is for movies" indicating that Star Wars TV shows would not have the crawl, but all movies would.
