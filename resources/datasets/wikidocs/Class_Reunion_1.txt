A class reunion is a meeting of former classmates, often organized at or near their former high school or college, by one or more class members.  It is scheduled near an anniversary of their graduation, e.g. every 5 or 10 years. Their teachers and administrators may also be invited. Those attending will usually reminisce about their student days and bring one another up to date on what has happened since they last met.
Some class reunions also include a reunion class gift to the institution.
