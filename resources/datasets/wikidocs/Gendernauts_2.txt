Monika Treut (born April 6, 1954, in Mönchengladbach, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany) is a German filmmaker. She made her feature film debut with Seduction: The Cruel Woman (co-directed by Elfi Mikesch), a film that explores sadomasochistic sex practices. She has made over 20 films, including the short documentaries Annie and My Father is Coming. Treut’s involvement extends across writing, directing, editing and acting.


== Education and career ==
Treut attended high school at an all-girls state school. She studied literature and Political Science at Philipps-University, Marburg. She wrote her PhD thesis about The Cruel Woman: Female Images in the Writing of Marquis de Sade and Leopold von Sacher-Masoch. After passing the state examination she graduated in 1978.
During her studies at university in the mid-1970s she began working with video. She worked as a media associate in Marburg, Frankfurt, and Berlin.
In 1984, Treut earned her doctorate degree in philology from the University of Marburg. That same year she founded Hyena Filmproduktion together with Elfi Mikesch, and began producing, writing, and directing independent feature films. The following year Treut made her feature film debut with Seduction: The Cruel Woman, a film that explored sadomasochistic sex practices. Treut also spent time in America during the 1980s. Traveling and working in San Francisco and New York City, Treut met and worked with Annie Sprinkle and Werner Schroeter, while also producing some of her own films. These relationships led to the films Annie (documentary short), My Father is Coming and Encounter with Werner Schroeter (documentary short).
Famous for her queer films, Treut also makes documentaries. Her films have explored many interests around the world. The subject matter varies from film to film; whether queer-themed, or about one woman's efforts to help street kids in Rio de Janeiro, or about the culinary arts of Taiwan—her documentaries find interesting, real people to focus on.
Throughout her film career Treut has been involved in several aspects of filmmaking, including acting, directing, producing, writing, filming, and editing. Her film catalogue includes over 20 films, both in her native language German and in English.
