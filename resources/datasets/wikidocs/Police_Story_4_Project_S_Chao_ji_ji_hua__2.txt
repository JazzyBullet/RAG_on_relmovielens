Supercop 2 (Chinese: 超級計劃) is a 1993 Hong Kong action film directed by Stanley Tong and starring Michelle Yeoh.  It is a spin-off of Jackie Chan's Police Story film series involving the character Yeoh portrayed in Supercop.
Although Jackie Chan only has a cameo appearance in this film, some DVD covers prominently featured Chan, misleading audiences into thinking he is one of the main characters. He reprises his role as Inspector Chan, but in drag to catch a criminal in drag wearing the same wig and clothes.
