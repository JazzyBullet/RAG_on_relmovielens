Originally created as a college newspaper strip, it featured subjects associated with college life at the time, with topics like "parking nazis", "shroom patrol" and "alliance for the vertically challenged", as well as computer-related situations.
The main characters were undergrads Zack, Scooby, Hilary and Sharon, and a cat named "Dio".
