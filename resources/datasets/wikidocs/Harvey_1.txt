== Early life ==
Broderick Stephen Harvey was born on January 17, 1957, in Welch, West Virginia, the son of Jesse Harvey, a coal miner, and Eloise Vera. His first name is Broderick, named after actor Broderick Crawford of the TV series Highway Patrol. Harvey had a severe stutter as a child, but eventually overcame it. In sixth grade, when he and his classmates were asked what their personal dreams were, he said that he wanted to be on TV when he grew up. His teacher thought his dream was unrealistic due to his severe stutter; she ridiculed Harvey in front of the class, and called his parents and told them he was being a "smart aleck". Harvey and his family moved to Cleveland, Ohio, living on East 112th Street, which was renamed Steve Harvey Way in 2015. He graduated from Glenville High School in 1974.
Shortly after high school, he attended Kent State University and West Virginia University, where he was a member of Omega Psi Phi fraternity, but never graduated. While Harvey has talked about overcoming his early life and educational obstacles, he later conceded, "It really threw my life into a downward spiral, and I regret not getting that degree."
