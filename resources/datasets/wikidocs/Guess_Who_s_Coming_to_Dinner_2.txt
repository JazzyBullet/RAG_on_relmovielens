Guess Who's Coming to Dinner is a reggae album and single by Black Uhuru. The album was first released under the title Showcase in 1979, then as a re-edition entitled Black Uhuru in 1980, with the addition of "Shine Eye Gal" (featuring a guest performance by Keith Richards on guitar), and with different mixes of the original LP tracks (some shorter, some longer.) The Guess Who's Coming to Dinner release, from 1983, is identical to the 1980 edition.
The album was listed in the 1999 book The Rough Guide: Reggae: 100 Essential CDs.
