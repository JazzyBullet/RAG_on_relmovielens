Something Wicked This Way Comes is a 1983 American dark fantasy film directed by Jack Clayton and produced by Walt Disney Productions, from a screenplay written by Ray Bradbury, based on his 1962 novel of the same name. It stars Jason Robards, Jonathan Pryce, Diane Ladd and Pam Grier.
The title was taken from a line in Act IV of William Shakespeare's Macbeth: "By the pricking of my thumbs / Something wicked this way comes". 
It was filmed in Vermont and at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California. It had a troubled production â€“ Clayton fell out with Bradbury over an uncredited script rewrite, and after test screenings of the director's cut failed to meet the studio's expectations, Disney sidelined Clayton, fired the original editor, scrapped the original score, delaying the film by five months, spent $4 million on the new changes, and spent many months re-shooting, re-editing, and re-scoring the film before its eventual release.
