The Trouble with... Harry was the debut album by British musician Harry (aka Dirty Harry). It was released on 21 April 2003 but failed to reach the UK album top 75.
The album encountered numerous delays during its recording and production and, following a lawsuit with Clint Eastwood over copyright issues with the name 'Dirty Harry', it had to be re-recorded.
The album contains 13 tracks, including the singles "So Real" and "Follow Me" as well as two older singles recorded under the name Dirty Harry, "Eye" and "Nothing Really Matters". "Push It (Real Good)", a sampling of the Salt-N-Pepa song "Push It" and a cover of Belouis Some's "Imagination" which appeared on Harry's "Under the Covers" EP were also included on the album.
