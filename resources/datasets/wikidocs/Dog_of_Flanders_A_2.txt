Dog of Flanders (フランダースの犬, Furandāsu no Inu) is a 1975 Japanese anime television series adaptation of Ouida's 1872 novel of the same name, produced by Nippon Animation. 52 episodes were produced. A film version was released in 1997.
The series represents the bond between a boy and his ever so faithful dog living in a 19th century Flanders village near Antwerp. The emotional story shows the boy's struggles in life as his grandfather dies and leaves him with his dog. It shows how the hopes of becoming a great classical painter have been seemingly crushed by his grandfather's passing and the way he takes after that tragedy.
The anime series is notable for being the first official entry in the World Masterpiece Theater series (Calpis Children's Theater at the time).
