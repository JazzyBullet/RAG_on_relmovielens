A Very Brady Sequel is a 1996 American comedy film directed by Arlene Sanford (in her feature film directorial debut), with a screenplay by Harry Elfont, Deborah Kaplan, James Berg and Stan Zimmerman, and starring Shelley Long, Gary Cole and Tim Matheson. It also features cameos from RuPaul, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Rosie O'Donnell, Barbara Eden, David Spade, and Richard Belzer.   
The film was quickly produced after the success of the first film, The Brady Bunch Movie. The Bradys, after successfully saving their home, deal with a new wave of problems. A valuable antique horse statue Carol owns is being sought after by a man named Roy, lying that he's Carol's first Husband with Roy befriending and living with the Bradys to steal the horse. The film essentially follows its predecessor, by placing the 1970s Brady Bunch family in a contemporary 1990s setting, where much of the humor is derived from the resulting culture clash and the utter lack of awareness they show toward their relatively unusual lifestyle.
A Very Brady Sequel was released on August 23, 1996. The film received mixed reviews and earned less than half of what The Brady Bunch Movie did at the box office. A second sequel, the made-for-television feature The Brady Bunch in the White House, aired in November 2002.
