Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III is a 1990 American slasher film directed by Jeff Burr and written by David J. Schow. It is the sequel to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986) and the third installment in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre film series. The film stars Kate Hodge, William Butler, Ken Foree, Tom Hudson, Viggo Mortensen, Joe Unger, and R.A. Mihailoff.. The plot follows Leatherface and his cannibalistic family stalking a motorist couple in the backroads of Texas.
The film was distributed by New Line Cinema, who bought the rights to the series from The Cannon Group after producing The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2. Initially, this film was given an X-rating by the Motion Picture Association of America, which limited the studio's release possibilities. After the studio made cuts, it was re-rated R, and New Line released it in the United States on January 12, 1990. It was refused classification in the United Kingdom upon its initial release. It has since been released on home video in both unrated and rated versions, and a cut version was accepted with an 18 certificate in the United Kingdom.
The film was both a critical and commercial failure, grossing $5.8 million at the United States box office, making it the poorest performing film in the series at the time, until the release of  the next film, Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation, in 1995.
