The Cup (Tibetan: ཕོར་པ། or Phörpa) is a 1999 Tibetan-language film written and directed by Khyentse Norbu in his feature directorial debut. The plot involves two young football-crazed Tibetan refugee novice monks who desperately try to obtain a television for their remote Himalayan monastery to watch the 1998 FIFA World Cup final.
The Cup was Bhutan's first-ever submission for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film, but it was not nominated.
