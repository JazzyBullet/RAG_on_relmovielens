Be the Creature is a TV series created by the Kratt Brothers (Chris and Martin), in which they immerse themselves in the lives of different animals around the world, living alongside them to experience their natural behaviors and habitats firsthand. The show combines adventure and education, offering insights into the lives of wildlife through the brothers' close encounters.
After years of filming Zoboomafoo and Kratts' Creatures in a studio, Chris and Martin Kratt desired to return to fieldwork, living closely with animals for extended periods. This led to the creation of "Be the Creature" for National Geographic, where they spent weeks living among grizzlies, lions, and other wildlife. Each episode, lasting 40 minutes, was distilled from approximately 75 hours of raw footage collected during each expedition. Be the Creature is oriented towards teens and adults, unlike the brothers' previous shows. It features some graphic footage in an effort to portray life in the wild truthfully.
A second season, Be the Creature 2, began in 2005. The show aired on National Geographic Wild. A third season, Be The Creature 3, began in 2007.
