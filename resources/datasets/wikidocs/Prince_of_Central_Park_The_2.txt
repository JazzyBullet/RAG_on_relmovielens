Prince of Central Park is a 1989 Broadway musical with music by Don Sebesky, lyrics by Gloria Nissenson and a book by Evan H. Rhodes.  It is based on Rhodes' 1974 novel The Prince of Central Park and its 1977 television movie adaptation which starred Ruth Gordon and Brooke Shields.  The musical was a notorious flop, losing nearly $2 million and closing after only four performances.  Today, it is best remembered for a humorously negative review by Frank Rich in The New York Times.
