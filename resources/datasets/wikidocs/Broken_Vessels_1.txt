Broken Vessels is a 1999 medical drama film directed by Scott Ziehl and written by Ziehl along with David Baer and John McMahon.  The film debuted at the Los Angeles Independent Film Festival and marked Ziehl's directorial debut.  It stars Todd Field, Jason London, Roxana Zal, Susan Traylor, and James Hong.  The film follows a rookie paramedic and his hardened drug-addicted partner as they take calls and cruise L.A. in their ambulance. Although it shares the same name as the book, it has nothing to do with the Andre Dubus essay collection of the same name.
