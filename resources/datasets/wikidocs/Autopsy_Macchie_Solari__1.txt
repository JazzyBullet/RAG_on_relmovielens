== Critical reception ==
Allmovie wrote, "This creepy whodunit [...] offers a few chills but is ultimately unsatisfying."
Marco Giusti feels that the film, like all films by Crispino, is a little slow and boring.
Rob Talbot wrote "You really do wonder what you’ve let yourself [in] for when this one kicks off, but it’ll certainly make you sit up and pay attention, whether you love or hate it."
