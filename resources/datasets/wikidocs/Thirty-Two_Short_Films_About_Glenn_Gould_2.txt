The episode depicts brief incidents experienced by a wide array of Springfield residents in a series of interconnected stories that take place over a single day. The episode's concept originated from the end segment of the season four episode "The Front", which gave the staff the idea of a possible spin-off from The Simpsons, and serves as a loose parody of Pulp Fiction. The title is a reference to the film Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould.
The episode received positive reviews from critics and is noted for its popularity among fans, with the "Steamed Hams" segment becoming a popular Internet meme in 2016.
