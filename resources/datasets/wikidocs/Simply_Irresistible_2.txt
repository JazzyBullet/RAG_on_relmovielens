"Simply Irresistible" is the first single released by English rock singer Robert Palmer from the 1988 studio album Heavy Nova.
In 1988, the song reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, being denied the top spot for two weeks by Guns N' Roses' "Sweet Child o' Mine".  It was No. 1 on Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks for three weeks. It also earned Palmer his second Grammy Award the following year, and the song was nominated for the Brit Award for Best British Single.
Cash Box called it a "hard charging power-guitar fueled rocker".
