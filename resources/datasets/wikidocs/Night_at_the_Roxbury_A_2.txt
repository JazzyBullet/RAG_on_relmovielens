Before the start of the season, Jim Breuer, who had been a cast member for three seasons since 1995, left the show on his own terms. Following Breuer's departure, the show added three new featured players: stand-up comedian Jimmy Fallon, Chris Parnell, a performer with The Groundlings in Los Angeles, and Upright Citizens Brigade and Second City performer Horatio Sanz. Fallon, Parnell, and Sanz were all upgraded to repertory status during the following season.
Following the finale, no changes were made to the cast, and everyone returned for the next season.
