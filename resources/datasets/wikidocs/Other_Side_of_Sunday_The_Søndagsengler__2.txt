The Kingdom of Norway has submitted films in the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film category at the Oscars since 1957. They only submitted two films in their first twenty years, but they became a regular fixture in the competition in 1980, failing to submit a film only once, in 1983.
The Academy Award for Best International Feature Film is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. It was not created until the 1956 Academy Awards, in which a competitive Academy Award of Merit, known as the Best Foreign Language Film Award, was created for non-English speaking films, and has been given annually since.
As of 2021, six films from Norway have been nominated for the award: Nine Lives (1957), The Pathfinder (1987), The Other Side of Sunday (1996), Elling (2001), Kon-Tiki (2012) and The Worst Person in the World (2021).
