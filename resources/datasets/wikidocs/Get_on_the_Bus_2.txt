"Get on the Bus" is a song recorded by American group Destiny's Child, featuring musician Timbaland, for the original motion picture soundtrack of Gregory Nava's romantic drama Why Do Fools Fall in Love (1998). It was written and produced by Timbaland and Missy Elliott. As with other Timbaland's 1990s productions, the song features some unorthodox elements, including bird sounds. It was released as the second single from Why Do Fools Fall in Love on September 21, 1998 by Columbia Records and Elektra Records.
"Get on the Bus" was a moderate commercial success throughout Europe, reaching the top 20 in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. In the United States, it received minor airplay on urban contemporary radio, peaking at number 63 on the US R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart. An accompanying music video for the song was directed by Earle Sebastian. The song was later included on the international editions of Destiny's Child's second studio album The Writing's on the Wall (1999) and included in the set list of their 2001â€“2002 world tour.
