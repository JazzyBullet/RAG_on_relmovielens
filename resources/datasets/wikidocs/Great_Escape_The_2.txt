The Great Escaper is a 2023 biographical drama film directed by Oliver Parker, written by William Ivory, and starring Michael Caine and Glenda Jackson. It is based on the true story of 89-year-old  British World War II Royal Navy veteran Bernard Jordan who "broke out" of his nursing home to attend the 70th anniversary D-Day commemorations in France in June 2014.
The Great Escaper had its world premiere in London at BFI Southbank on 20 September 2023, and was released in the United Kingdom on 6 October 2023, by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film marked the final screen performances for both lead actors: Jackson died in June 2023, nine months after filming finished; Caine announced his retirement from acting in October 2023. This is also the last film produced by Path√© UK, after the division announced  in November 2023 that they would restructure to focus on premium television and only release films from their parent company.
Another film, The Last Rifleman starring Pierce Brosnan and released on 5 November 2023, is loosely based on Jordan's story.
