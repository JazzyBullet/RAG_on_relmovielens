Open Your Eyes (Spanish: Abre los ojos) is a 1997 Spanish film directed and co-scored by Alejandro Amenábar & written by Amenábar and Mateo Gil. It stars Eduardo Noriega, Penélope Cruz, Chete Lera, Fele Martínez and Najwa Nimri. In 2002, Open Your Eyes was ranked no. 84 in the Top 100 Sci-Fi List by the Online Film Critics Society. 
The film's intersecting planes of dream and reality have prompted some critics to suggest comparisons to Calderón de la Barca's 1635 play Life Is a Dream. An American remake entitled Vanilla Sky, directed by Cameron Crowe, was released in 2001, with Penélope Cruz reprising her role.
