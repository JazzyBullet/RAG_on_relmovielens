Tales from the Hood is a 1995 American black horror anthology film directed by Rusty Cundieff. The film presents four short urban-themed horror stories based on problems that affect the African-American community: police corruption, domestic abuse, racism, and gang violence. These are presented within a frame story of three drug dealers buying some "found" drugs from an eccentric and story-prone funeral director.
