"The Very Thought of You" is a pop standard that was recorded and published in 1934 with music and lyrics by Ray Noble. The song was first recorded by Ray Noble and His Orchestra with Al Bowlly on vocals for HMV in England in April 1934. This record was then released in the United States by Victor, and it reached number one for five weeks on the pop music charts.
The song was the subject of litigation in 1962. In 1934, Noble assigned the copyright to British publisher Campbell, Connelly & Company. Before the copyright was renewed, however, Noble assigned the United States copyright to M. Witmark & Sons. A suit was brought by Campbell, Connelly against Noble, stating that the assignment covered all rights, including rights in the US. A British High Court judge ruled in favor of Campbell, Connelly.
