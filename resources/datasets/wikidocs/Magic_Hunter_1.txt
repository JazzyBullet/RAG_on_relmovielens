== Reception ==
Film critic Stephen Holden described it as "an unwieldy stylistic hybrid of narrative film making and arty montage" and as "klutzy and vague in its symbolic connections".  Deseret News' critic Jeff Vice noted that "Enyedi has an interesting visual style, but she's too busy to concentrate on the storyline". According to Barbara Shulgasser, "Enyedi's visuals, shot by Tibor Mathe, are often beautiful enough to distract you from narrative failings".
