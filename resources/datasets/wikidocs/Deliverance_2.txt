Kingdom Come: Deliverance is a 2018 action role-playing video game developed and published by Warhorse Studios, and co-published by Deep Silver. The game is set in the medieval Kingdom of Bohemia, an Imperial State of the Holy Roman Empire, with a focus on historically accurate content.
The story takes place during a war in Bohemia in 1403, in the times of King Wenceslaus IV. On the orders of Hungarian king Sigismund, half-brother of Wenceslaus, Cuman mercenaries raid the mining village of Skalitz, a major source of silver. One of the survivors of the resulting massacre is Henry, the son of a blacksmith. Destitute and vengeful, Henry joins the service of Lord Radzig Kobyla, who leads a resistance movement against Sigismund's invasion. As Henry pursues justice for his murdered family, he becomes involved in an effort to restore Bohemia's rightful king and Sigismund's half-brother, Wenceslaus IV, to the throne. The game features branching quest lines, an open world environment, and period-accurate weapons, clothing, combat techniques, and architecture (recreated with the assistance of architects and historians), which encourages immersive gameplay.
Kingdom Come: Deliverance was released for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One on 13 February 2018, and on 15 March 2024 for Nintendo Switch. The game received generally mixed reviews from critics, who praised the story, attention to detail, and focus on realism, while criticism was aimed at technical bugs. It has sold over 6 million units as of February 2024.
On 18 April 2024, the sequel, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, was announced for the same year.
