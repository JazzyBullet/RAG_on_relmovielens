Poison Ivy (Dr. Pamela Lillian Isley  EYEZ-lee) is a character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by writer Robert Kanigher and artist Carmine Infantino, she debuted in Batman #181 (June 1966), and has become one of the superhero Batman's most enduring enemies belonging to the collective of adversaries that make up his rogues gallery.
In her comic book appearances, Poison Ivy is depicted as a botanist-turned-misanthropic ecoterrorist in Gotham City with the ability to control all plant life. Empowered by an elemental force known as the Green, Ivy attempts to protect the sanctity and supremacy of nature at all costs by lashing out against humanity, which brings her into conflict with Batman. While usually portrayed as a supervillain, Ivy has also been an antiheroine at times as well as the primary love interest of Harley Quinn as of The New 52 and DC Rebirth relaunches. A one-piece costume adorned with leaves and vines serves as Poison Ivy's visual motif.
Poison Ivy has been adapted in various media incarnations, having been portrayed by Uma Thurman in the 1997 film Batman & Robin, Clare Foley, Maggie Geha and Peyton List in the Fox television series Gotham, and Bridget Regan in The CW's Arrowverse series Batwoman.
