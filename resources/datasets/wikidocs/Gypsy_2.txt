Gypsy-Rose Alcida Blanchard (born July 27, 1991) is an American woman convicted of second-degree murder in Springfield, Missouri for the death of her mother, Dee Dee Blanchard. She was sentenced to ten years in prison. 
She was paroled after eight years, at the end of December 2023. Given the sensational aspects of Gypsy's childhood, she gained widespread media attention. Hulu produced a limited series, The Act (2019), released while she was still in prison. She has been featured on interviews on a variety of TV shows, and other programs have been based on her story.
