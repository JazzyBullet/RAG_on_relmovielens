Area code 900 is a telephone area code in the North American Numbering Plan for premium-rate telephone numbers. Area code 900 was installed in 1971.
Premium rate services are dialed in the format 1-900-XXX-XXXX. This is often called a 900 number or a 1 900 number ("one-nine-hundred").
A call to a 900-number can result in high per-minute or per-call charges. For example, a "psychic hotline" may charge US$2.99 for the first minute and US$0.99 for each additional minute.
