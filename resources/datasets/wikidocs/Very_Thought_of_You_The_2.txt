The Very Thought of You is a 1944 romantic drama film directed by Delmer Daves and starring Dennis Morgan, Eleanor Parker and Dane Clark. The screenplay focuses on a couple who knew each other when he was in college. They meet by chance, fall in love and marry while he is on a short Thanksgiving leave before starting special training. Except for the opening scene on Attu, the on-screen action stays on the homefront, showing how the years of war affect their lives and the lives of their friends, her troubled family, and others.
