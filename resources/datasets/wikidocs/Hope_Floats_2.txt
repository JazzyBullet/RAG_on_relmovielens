One cut from the album, Garth Brooks' rendition of "To Make You Feel My Love", reached No. 1 on the Billboard country singles charts in August 1998. This song also appeared on a re-release of Brooks's 1995 album Fresh Horses which was included in his 1998 box set The Limited Series.
The Bob Seger-Martina McBride duet "Chances Are" peaked at No. 23 on the Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart in 1998. Lila McCann's "To Get Me to You" was also released as a radio single, but did not chart. Paul Davis's 1981 single "Cool Night," which reached No. 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1981, is also included on the album.
A remastered and expanded soundtrack was released on April 24, 2007, featuring an additional six tracks but removing Brooks's song.  Garth Brooks’ “To Make You Feel My Love,” a No. 1 country single on the original soundtrack, was not included. Brooks, who controlled his own recordings, sold his music exclusively through Wal-Mart at the time.
