An Extremely Goofy Movie is a 2000 animated comedy film distributed by Walt Disney Home Video, produced by Walt Disney Television Animation, and directed by Douglas McCarthy. It is a standalone sequel to the 1995 film A Goofy Movie and the finale to the television series Goof Troop, in which Max Goof goes to college and believes he will not have to deal with his father, Goofy, until he loses his job and enrolls there to receive the degree he never received years ago in order to have another go. Meanwhile, Max and his friends compete in the College X Games, unaware of the reason why the school's top fraternity has a dynasty in the competition. This sequel quietly reduces the themes that were heavily exploited in the predecessor.
The film was released on Blu-ray as a Disney Movie Club exclusive alongside A Goofy Movie on April 23, 2019.
