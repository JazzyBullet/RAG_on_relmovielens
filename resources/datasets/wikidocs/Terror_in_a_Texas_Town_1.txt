Terror in a Texas Town is a 1958 American Western film directed by Joseph H. Lewis (billed only as "Joseph Lewis") and starring Sterling Hayden, Nedrick Young, and Sebastian Cabot.
The script of Terror in a Texas Town was written by Dalton Trumbo. Due to Trumbo's status on the Hollywood blacklist as one of the Hollywood 10, Ben Perry initially received screenwriting credit, lending his name as a front for Trumbo. Both Nedrick Young, who contributed to the screenplay as well as acting in the film, and Sterling Hayden had also been subject to the Blacklist and the investigations of Communist influence in the movie industry by the House Committee on Un-American Activities.
Director Lewis was set to retire when his friend Young handed him the script, hoping to get him back into the film business. Excited by the script, Lewis agreed to do it because he had nothing to fear from working with blacklisted artists as it was to be his final film. He directed television episodes for several more years before retiring in 1966.
