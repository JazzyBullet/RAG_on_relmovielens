Quest for Camelot is an action role-playing game developed and published by Titus Interactive with assistance from Nintendo for the Game Boy Color in 1998. It is based on the animated Warner Bros. movie of the same title. The game is compatible with the Super Game Boy, Game Boy Printer and as well as play on the original Game Boy. A Nintendo 64 version of the game was planned but was scrapped due to the film's poor performance at the box office.
The game was added to the Nintendo Switch Online service on September 6, 2023.
