One Simple Wish is a non-profit that uses technology to raise awareness about foster care and connect caring people to kids in need. One Simple Wish had developed a unique wish granting platform that allows anyone to browse and grant wishes made by young people impacted by foster care and those in under-served communities.   Examples of granted wishes include bikes, laptops, books, eye glasses, tickets to concerts and shows, clothing, and playground equipment.
