My Man Godfrey is a 1957 American CinemaScope comedy film starring June Allyson and David Niven.  It was adapted by Peter Berneis, William Bowers and Everett Freeman, and directed by Henry Koster. The film is a color remake of Gregory La Cava's 1936 screwball comedy of the same name. Allyson played the role created by Carole Lombard in the original version, and Niven took on the role made famous by William Powell. Niven had played the role of Tommy Gray, Godfrey's former classmate, in a 1938 radio version. While the original film from 1936 did not have its copyright renewed and is in the public domain, this film's copyright was renewed. Both films are derivative works of the still copyrighted novel from 1935.
