Best Men is a 1997 American crime comedy film directed by Tamra Davis, and stars Sean Patrick Flanery, Luke Wilson, Andy Dick, Mitchell Whitfield, Fred Ward, Drew Barrymore and Dean Cain.
In the film, a man's wedding is set for the day of his release from prison. His four best friends will serve as groomsmen. One of the friends has recently started robbing banks, and he stops for another bank robbery on the way to the ceremony. The other men enter the bank after him, and unwittingly create a hostage situation. The FBI takes over the hostage negotiation. But the lead agent plans to execute all of the "robbers", and is not interested in the safety of the hostages.
