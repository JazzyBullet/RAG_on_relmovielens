Tarzan and the Lost City is a 1998 American adventure film directed by Carl Schenkel, and starring Casper Van Dien and Jane March with Steven Waddington. The screenplay by Bayard Johnson and J. Anderson Black is loosely based on the Tarzan stories by Edgar Rice Burroughs. The film received largely negative reviews and was a box office bomb.
One of the film's producers, Stanley S. Canter, had previously produced another Tarzan film for Warner Bros., Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes (1984).
