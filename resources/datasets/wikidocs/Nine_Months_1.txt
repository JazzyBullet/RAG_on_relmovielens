== Plot ==
Child psychologist Samuel Faulkner is in a long-term relationship with ballet teacher Rebecca Taylor. This changes when Rebecca declares that she is pregnant. When questioned by Samuel about her birth control, she replies that birth control is only 97% effective.
Samuel's fears mount due to his encounters with overbearing couple Marty and Gail Dwyer and their three young unruly daughters, as well as the confusing advice he receives from Sean, his perpetually single artist friend and Gail's brother. Samuel is confused and unsure about what to do. Feeling that Samuel is not ready to be a father, Rebecca leaves him and moves in with Marty and Gail (who is also pregnant with a fourth child). Samuel tries to contact her, but she ignores him. Sean encourages him to move on, with Samuel trying new things, like rollerblading, getting an earring, and going to parties. But the thought of Rebecca still weighs heavily on his mind.
When a woman makes a move on Samuel at a party, he declines, saying that he is not ready to move on yet. He views an ultrasound of his soon-to-be-born son, and decides that it is time to take responsibility before it is too late. He sells his Porsche, buys a family car, and reconciles with Rebecca, much to Gail's delight.
Samuel and Rebecca wed, and not long afterward, they go out to dinner. During an awkward moment when they bump into the woman who he met earlier at the party, Rebecca goes into labor. They rush to the hospital, where they meet Marty and Gail; who has gone into labor as well. Rebecca gives birth to their baby boy, who they name Samuel, and Gail gives birth to their fourth daughter, who they name Becky.

On film aggregate Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 27%, based on 33 reviews, with an average rating of 4.8/10. The site's critics consensus states: "Nine Months finds writer-director Chris Columbus playing to his worst comedic instincts -- and relying far too heavily on the trademark tics of his miscast leading man." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 47 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade "Aâˆ’" on scale of A+ to F.
Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film two stars out of four, saying, "Nine Months is one of those movies where the outcome is abundantly clear to everyone but the hero, who remains in the hapless position of playing dumb because, if he didn't, there wouldn't be a plot."
