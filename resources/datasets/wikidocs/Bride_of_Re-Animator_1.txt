Bride of Re-Animator is a 1990 American comedy horror film produced and directed by Brian Yuzna and written by Yuzna, Rick Fry, and Woody Keith. It is a sequel to the 1985 film Re-Animator and the second entry in the Re-Animator film series. Like its predecessor, it is loosely based on the serialized story "Herbert Westâ€“Reanimator" (1921-1922) by H. P. Lovecraft. Unlike its predecessor, it was released direct-to-video.
The plot of Bride of Re-Animator roughly follows episodes "V. The Horror from the Shadows" and "VI. The Tomb-Legions" of the Lovecraft story, and follows doctors Herbert West and Dan Cain as they attempt to create a living woman from dead tissue. The film stars Bruce Abbott, Claude Earl Jones, Fabiana Udenio, David Gale, and Kathleen Kinmont, with Jeffrey Combs as Herbert West. It was followed by a sequel, Beyond Re-Animator, released in 2003.
