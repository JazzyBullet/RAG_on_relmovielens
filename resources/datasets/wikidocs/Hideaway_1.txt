"Hideaway" is the debut single by Canadian recording musician Kiesza from her debut EP of the same name (2014) and her debut studio album, Sound of a Woman (2014). The song was released on April 11, 2014 through Island Records and co-writer Rami Samir Afuni's independent label Lokal Legend as the lead single from both the EP and the album. 
Written by Kiesza and its producer Afuni, it was recorded in the summer of 2013 in New York City. "Hideaway" is a deep house song which comes from inspiration from both Kiesza and Afuni's passion for 1990s dance music. Both the song and its accompanying music video have been met with general acclaim from contemporary music critics. "Hideaway" topped the UK Singles Chart upon release, selling over 136,000 copies in its first week, becoming the third-fastest selling single of 2014 in the United Kingdom.
