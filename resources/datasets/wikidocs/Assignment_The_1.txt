Designated for assignment (DFA) is a contractual term used in Major League Baseball (MLB). A player who is designated for assignment is immediately removed from the team's 40-man roster, after which the team must, within seven days, return the player to the 40-man roster, place the player on waivers, trade the player, release the player, or "send outright" the player from the 40-man roster into Minor League Baseball.
