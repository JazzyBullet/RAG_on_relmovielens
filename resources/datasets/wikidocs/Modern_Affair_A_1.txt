A Modern Affair is a 1996 independent feature film directed by Vern Oakley and produced by Tribe Pictures.
Starring Stanley Tucci and Lisa Eichhorn, the film's plot reverses the conventions of romantic comedies. Instead of a man meeting a woman, falling in love, marrying, and having a baby, the woman gets pregnant, meets the child's father, and falls in love.
Winner of the Long Island Festival Audience Award, A Modern Affair played theatrically, was broadcast by HBO and distributed by Columbia TriStar Home Video.
