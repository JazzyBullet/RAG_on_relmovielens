Women's parking spaces are specially designated and identified parking spaces in parking garages and parking lots to be used by women. They are usually much larger than normal parking spots to reduce accidents and near exits to increase the safety of women, to facilitate parking, or to facilitate walking to shopping or employment destinations.
To improve women's safety, some companies have improved lighting in their garage, installed surveillance systems, and have reserved parking spots closer to entrances for female-only parking. Some parking spots are painted bright pink to distinguish them as female only, and may also have a "female only" sign. Some women's parking facilities are also widened to make maneuvering in and out with children easier.
