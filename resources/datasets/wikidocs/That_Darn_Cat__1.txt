That Darn Cat! is a 1965 American thriller comedy film directed by Robert Stevenson and starring Hayley Mills and Dean Jones in a story about bank robbers, a kidnapping and a mischievous cat. Produced by Walt Disney Productions, the film was based on the 1963 novel Undercover Cat by Gordon and Mildred Gordon. The title song was written by the Sherman Brothers and sung by Bobby Darin.
That Darn Cat! was Hayley Mills' last film of the six she appeared in for the Walt Disney Productions, until she returned in 1986 for three Parent Trap films. Mills later said it was a mistake to leave Disney. It was Dean Jones' first film for Disney.  A remake of the film was released in 1997, and features a cameo appearance by Jones.
