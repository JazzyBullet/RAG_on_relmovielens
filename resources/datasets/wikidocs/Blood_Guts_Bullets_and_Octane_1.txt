Blood, Guts, Bullets, and Octane is a 1998 American independent action comedy film written, produced, edited, directed and starring Joe Carnahan in his feature-length directorial debut.
For years the film was under negotiation for development as a prime time series on NBC by Carnahan and producer Bob Levy.


== Premise ==
The film stars Carnahan and the film's other producer Dan Leis as two salesmen of a failing used car dealership who are paid $250,000 to allow a 1963 Pontiac LeMans convertible onto the dealership lot for two days. They later find out that the vehicle may have been stolen, which results in a chase and the car being held for ransom.
