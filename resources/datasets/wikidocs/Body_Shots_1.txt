== Production ==
Tara Reid said the only reason she did a nude scene in this movie was because her character was getting raped: "I'd never do a scene where my character takes off her shirt for no reason, for just a little T&A. That's stupid. That's exploiting yourself. I pass on a lot of movies where they want me to do nude stuff where it's not necessary for the role. It makes a film cheesy."


== Reception ==
The film was critically panned. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 11% based on reviews from 28 critics. On Metacritic the film has a score of 36% based on reviews from 29 critics.
