Aladdin is a fictional character in Disney's animated film Aladdin based on "Aladdin", a folk tale of Middle Eastern origin. He is voiced by Scott Weinger, while his singing voice is provided by Brad Kane. He also stars in the two direct-to-video sequels The Return of Jafar (1994) and Aladdin and the King of Thieves (1996), as well as the animated television series based on the film and the crossover Hercules and the Arabian Night. Mena Massoud played a live-action version of the character in a live action adaptation of the 1992 film.
When Aladdin is initially introduced, he is an 18-year-old man. He never received a formal education and has only learned by living on the streets of the city of Agrabah. He has to steal food in the local market in order to survive. When Aladdin was only an infant, his father, Cassim, left him and his mother to find a better life for his family.
