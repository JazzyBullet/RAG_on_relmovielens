Ferris Bueller is an American sitcom television series based on the 1986 John Hughes film Ferris Bueller's Day Off. The show stars Charlie Schlatter in the title role. The series debuted on August 23, 1990, on NBC and was cancelled within its first season, a few months after its debut with only 13 episodes aired, due to its poor reception. The show was produced by Maysh, Ltd. Productions in association with Paramount Television.  Hughes was not involved in the show's production.


== Synopsis ==
Though based on the film, the series was not a canon continuation; rather it was set up to portray itself as being the "real life" situations upon which the film was loosely based. In the pilot episode, Ferris (Schlatter) refers to the film and expresses his displeasure at Matthew Broderick portraying him, even going as far as destroying a life-size cardboard cutout of Broderick with a chainsaw. However, no further references to the film within the series' continuity would be made after this. As in the film, the series focused on Ferris Bueller and his high school experiences at Ocean Park High, including dealing with his best friend Cameron (Brandon Douglas), love interest Sloan (Ami Dolenz), and sister Jeannie (Jennifer Aniston).
Although the film was set in Chicago, the series was set in Santa Monica. Like the film, Ferris is liked by everyone as the "cool guy on campus." He is extremely popular, suave, and quick-witted and is a master of ceremonies who often breaks the fourth wall. Cameron is still a depressive neurotic who, through Ferris, is able to loosen up occasionally. Sloan is portrayed slightly different in that she is not completely wrapped around Ferris' finger and has to be won over at times. Ed Rooney is the primary antagonist and always out to get Ferris but usually ends up foiled or humiliated. His secretary, Grace, is not a wise-cracking sarcastic, but a passive pushover with an unreciprocated crush on Ed. Jeannie is constantly at odds with Ferris and his being favored by all. Though she can be antagonistic, she has proven not all bad, albeit begrudgingly. In the film, Mr. and Mrs. Bueller's names are Katie and Tom, but in the series, they are Barbara and Bill; also, Ferris is a junior and Jeannie is a senior as opposed to the other way around in the movie.

== Reception and cancellation ==
Compared to the film, the show received mostly negative reviews from critics. It also suffered from comparisons to another series, Parker Lewis Can't Lose, which proved to be more successful when it came to ratings, lasting for three seasons. Ratings for a Ferris "sneak preview" were strong, but ratings for the actual series were much lower. In an October 5, 1990 interview, NBC executive Warren Littlefield said the show was already in danger of cancellation, and could be pulled from the schedule as soon as the ratings for episode 4 came in. The series was cancelled due to poor viewership and low ratings after one season, airing a total of thirteen episodes.
