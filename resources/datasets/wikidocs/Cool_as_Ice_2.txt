Cool as Ice (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) is the soundtrack to David Kellogg's 1991 film Cool as Ice. It was released on October 8, 1991, via SBK Records. Production was handled by Gail "Sky" King and Chris Cuben-Tatum. It features contributions from the film star Vanilla Ice, alongside Derek B, Lonnie Gordon, Naomi Campbell, Partners in Kryme, Rozalla and Stanley Clarke among others.
The album peaked at number 89 on the Billboard 200. The album and film follows on after the worldwide success of To the Extreme.
The song "I Want U 2 Know" by American singer Denise Lopez was not on the official soundtrack album, although the track was one of the main themes of the film, played during the Kristin Minter scenes. The song is a power pop ballad, which was released originally in 1990 and later obtained moderate airplay during 1991 and the first half of 1992 in the United States, due to its exposure in the film.
The title track was nominated for a Razzie Award for Worst Original Song, but lost to "Addams Groove" by MC Hammer from The Addams Family.
