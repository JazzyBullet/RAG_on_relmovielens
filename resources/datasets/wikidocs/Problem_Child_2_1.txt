Problem Child 2 is a 1991 American black comedy film, and sequel to the 1990 film Problem Child; a continuation of the exploits of Junior (Michael Oliver), an adopted orphan boy who deliberately wreaks comedic havoc everywhere he goes. John Ritter returns as his adopted father, Ben Healy. Amy Yasbeck, who played Ben's wife, Flo, in the first film, also returns, this time as school nurse Annie Young with a daughter named Trixie (Ivyann Schwan) who's also a problem child.
It was directed by Brian Levant in his feature film directorial debut and produced by Robert Simonds, who also produced the first one. In addition, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski return as screenwriters. It was rated PG-13, unlike the first one, which was rated PG. It did not fare as well as the first one, although it was still successful at the box office.
