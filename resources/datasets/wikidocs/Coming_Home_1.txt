"Coming Home" (commonly referred to by unofficial titles such as the Folgers Incest Ad or the Folgers "Brother and Sister" Commercial) is a 2009 television commercial for Folgers Coffee. The commercial was created by the advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi with the intention of emulating Folgers's 1980s commercial "Peter Comes Home For Christmas". The commercial became infamous after many viewers perceived that the brother-sister main characters were either engaged in or desired an incestuous relationship. The commercial inspired multiple works of fan fiction (collectively referred to as "Folgercest" or "Folgerscest"), including an entire section on the website Archive of Our Own; fan art; and parody videos.
