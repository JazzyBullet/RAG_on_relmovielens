The Exorcist is an American horror media franchise that originated with William Peter Blatty's 1971 horror novel of the same name (itself inspired by the 1949 exorcism of Roland Doe) and most prominently featured in a 1973 film adaptation of the novel, and many subsequent prequels and sequels. All of these installments focus on fictional accounts of people possessed by Pazuzu, the main antagonist of the series, and the efforts of religious authorities to counter this possession.
The films have grossed over $661 million at the worldwide box office and the novel has sold over 13 million copies. 20th Century Fox Television developed a 2016 television series as a continuation of the 1973 film, to generally positive reviews. As of 2020, a reboot of the film series, which was later changed to a direct sequel to the 1973 film was in development with David Gordon Green as director. Produced by Blumhouse Productions, the film was released by Universal Pictures on October 6, 2023. Following the failure of the film, plans for a trilogy were scrapped in favor of a reboot with Mike Flanagan as director.
