This season of the series sees 12 new HouseGuest compete against two HouseGuests from the prior editions and who are referred to as "All-Stars".

Todd Clements was named Canada's Favourite Houseguest by popular vote.


== Format ==

Big Brother Canada follows a group of contestants, known as House Guests who move into a custom-built house outfitted with cameras and microphones, recording their every move 24 hours a day. The House Guests are sequestered in the Big Brother Canada House with no contact with the outside world. During their stay, the House Guests share their thoughts on events and other HouseGuests inside a private room referred to as the Diary Room. At the start of each week in the house, the House Guests compete for the title of Head of Household, often shortened to simply HoH. The winner of the HoH competition is immune from eviction and will name two House Guests to be nominated for eviction. After the nominees are determined, the Power of Veto competition is played. Five players will compete in the competition: the two nominees and three random players, with the winner receiving the Power of Veto. If a House Guest chooses to exercise the Power of Veto, the Head of Household is obligated to name a replacement nominee. The holder of the Power of Veto is safe from being nominated as the replacement nominee. On eviction night, all House Guests must vote to evict one of the nominees, with the exception of the nominees and the Head of Household. The eviction vote is by secret ballot, with House Guests casting their votes orally in the Diary Room. In the event of a tied vote, the Head of Household will cast a tie-breaking vote publicly. The nominee with the majority of the votes is evicted from the house. Midway through the season, the evicted House Guests go on to become members of the "jury"; the jury is responsible for choosing who wins the series. The final Head of Household competition is split into three parts; the winners of the first two rounds compete in the third and final round. Once only two House Guests remain, the members of the jury cast their votes for who should win the series.
