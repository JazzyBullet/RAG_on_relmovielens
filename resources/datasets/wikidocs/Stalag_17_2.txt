In  Germany, stalag (; German: [ˈʃtalak]) was a term used for prisoner-of-war camps. Stalag is a contraction of "Stammlager", itself short for Kriegsgefangenen-Mannschaftsstammlager, literally "main camp for enlisted prisoners of war" (officers were kept in an "Oflag"). Therefore, "stalag" technically means "main camp".
