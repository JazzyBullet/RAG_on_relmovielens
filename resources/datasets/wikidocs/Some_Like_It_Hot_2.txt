The musical, like the film, follows the story of jazz age musicians struggling during Prohibition. 
The show received positive reviews from critics, and went on to receive a leading 13 nominations at the 76th Tony Awards, including Best Musical, with J. Harrison Ghee getting a nomination for and subsequently winning Best Leading Actor in a Musical, making them one of the first openly non-binary performers to be nominated for Tonys.
