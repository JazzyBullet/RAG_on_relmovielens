"First Contact" is the 15th episode of the fourth season (and the 89th episode overall) of the American science fiction television series Star Trek: The Next Generation.
Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, during an away mission to observe a pre-warp civilization, Commander Riker is injured and brought to a hospital, where the locals quickly realize he is not from their world. Despite the attempted intervention of the planet's sympathetic science minister, Picard and Troi's efforts to retrieve Riker are stymied by the government's concern about the social crisis that a widespread revelation of his presence could trigger.
