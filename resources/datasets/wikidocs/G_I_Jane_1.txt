G.I. Jane is a 1997 American action drama film directed by Ridley Scott and starring Demi Moore, Viggo Mortensen, and Anne Bancroft. The film tells the fictional story of the first woman to undergo special operations training similar to the U.S. Navy SEALs.
The film was produced by Largo Entertainment, Scott Free Productions, and Caravan Pictures, and distributed by Hollywood Pictures. Though it received generally favorable reviews and Moore's performance received some praise, she still won the Razzie Award for Worst Actress. It opened at No. 1 at the US Box Office, where it remained for two weeks, but ultimately became a box-office bomb, grossing $48 million on a $50 million budget.
Many years after its release, the film was quoted again in the media after a joke made by American comedian Chris Rock on Academy Awards night, which resulted in a fateful scandal.
Despite the film's mediocre box office, Moore, in her autobiography Inside Out, called G.I. Jane her proudest professional achievement.
