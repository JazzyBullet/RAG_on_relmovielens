Naked Attraction is a British television dating game show produced by Studio Lambert and broadcast on Channel 4. Hosted by Anna Richardson, the show premiered on 25 July 2016 and has aired twelve series. The series premise involves a clothed single person presented with a gallery of six nude potential partners, who are hidden behind differently colored booths that concurrently reveal themselves from the bottom up.
Two special series titled Best Naughty Bits have aired from 18 May 2021 to 15 June 2021, and from 6 to 20 April 2022, whilst special titled All Out & Proud aired on 23 June 2022. During its run, Naked Attraction has been the subject of numerous complaints to Ofcom for its full-frontal nudity, but Ofcom declined to perform an investigation due to the lack of sexual activity and the series' timeslot.
