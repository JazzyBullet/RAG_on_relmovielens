Mr. Wrong is a 1996 American romantic black comedy film starring Ellen DeGeneres and Bill Pullman and produced by Touchstone Pictures and Mandeville Films. Released on February 16, 1996, by Buena Vista Pictures Distribution, the film grossed $12.8 million. It was a critical failure and box office bomb. DeGeneres used to mention it occasionally in her talk show, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, poking fun at the disastrous reception of her major film debut. As of 2023, it remains her first and only film as lead actor in a live action film.
