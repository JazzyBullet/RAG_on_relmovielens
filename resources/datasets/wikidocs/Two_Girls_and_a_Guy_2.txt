Two Guys and a Girl (titled Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place for the first two seasons) is an American television sitcom created by Rick Wiener, Kenny Schwartz, and Danny Jacobson. The series started as a short-run (thirteen episodes) mid-season replacement on March 11, 1998, on ABC. The series ran for four seasons, ending with a planned series finale, its eighty-first episode, on May 16, 2001.
The series starred Ryan Reynolds, Richard Ruccolo, and Traylor Howard as the title characters. The second season saw the arrival of two additional recurring characters: Johnny Donnelly (Nathan Fillion) and Ashley Walker (Suzanne Cryer). In 2000, for the fourth season, ABC moved the sitcom from midweek to a Friday night death slot, leading to a steep drop in ratings. After the show moved back to Wednesday for a two-week trial in an unsuccessful attempt to regain ratings, it was cancelled in May 2001. The series finale was titled "The Internet Show", an episode in which fans of the show voted on the characters' outcome online.
