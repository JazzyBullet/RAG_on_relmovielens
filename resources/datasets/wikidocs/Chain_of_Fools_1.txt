"Chain of Fools" is a song written by Don Covay. Aretha Franklin first released the song as a single in 1967 and subsequently it appeared on many of her albums.  It hit number one on the Billboard Hot Rhythm & Blues chart and number two on Billboard's  Hot 100 chart.  In the lyrics, the singer has been with her boyfriend for five years but realizes she's one of his "chain of fools," women with whom he's been cheating.  Others tell her to leave him, but she says his love is too strong and she's too weak.  Yet someday, she predicts the chain will break.
