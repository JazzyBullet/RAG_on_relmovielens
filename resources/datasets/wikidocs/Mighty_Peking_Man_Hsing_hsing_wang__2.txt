Infra-Man (Chinese: 中國超人, lit. Chinese Superman), also titled The Super Inframan, is a 1975 Hong Kong science fiction Superhero action film produced by the Shaw Brothers Studio. Inspired by the huge success of the Japanese tokusatsu franchises such as Ultraman and Kamen Rider in Hong Kong, this film features the same type of "henshin"/transformation, monster/robot fights, and Chinese kung fu action.
