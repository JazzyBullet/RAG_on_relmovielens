Dreamscapes is a limited edition eight-CD set of rare Alphaville recordings, released in 1999. It features 124 tracks with a total playing time of around 9.5 hours. 43 of the songs had never been available before, and all of the remainder had been remixed.
The four double CDs were packaged in a large (A4-sized) box, and accompanied by a large 64-page booklet, containing lyrics, rare photographs and original short fiction. Inside the box were 4 double-CDs, the cover of each was 1/4 of the overall box art.
A promotional copy called "Visions of Dreamscapes" was released to accompany the album. A shorter version of the set titled Dreamscapes Revisited was released in 2005.
