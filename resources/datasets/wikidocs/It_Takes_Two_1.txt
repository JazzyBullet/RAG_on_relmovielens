It Takes Two is a 2021 cooperative action-adventure platform video game developed by Hazelight Studios and published by Electronic Arts. The game was released for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S in March 2021, and was released for Nintendo Switch in November 2022. Like Hazelight's debut game A Way Out, it does not have a single-player option. It is playable only in either online or local split screen cooperative multiplayer between two players.
It Takes Two received positive reviews from critics and won multiple year-end accolades, including Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2021 and the 25th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards. The game has sold over 16 million units as of March 2024.
