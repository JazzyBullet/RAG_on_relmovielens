52 pickup or 52-card pickup is a humorous prank which consists only of picking up a scattered deck of  playing cards. It is typically played as a practical joke, where the "dealer" creates the false impression that a legitimate game will be played, then simply throws the entire deck into the air so the cards land strewn on the floor, and instructs other players to pick them up.
