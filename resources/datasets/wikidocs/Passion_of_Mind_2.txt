Demi Gene Moore ( də-MEE; née Guynes; born November 11, 1962) is an American actress and producer. She first gained attention on daytime television before breaking out as a film star in the 1980s. By the mid-1990s, she was the highest-paid actress at the time. She has earned several accolades, including nominations for a Primetime Emmy Award and two Golden Globes.
Moore began acting in 1981, and appeared on the soap opera General Hospital (1982–1984). After departing the show, she rose to prominence as a member of the Brat Pack, starring in the films Blame It on Rio (1984), St. Elmo's Fire (1985), and About Last Night... (1986). She earned recognition and stardom for her role in Ghost (1990), which was the highest-grossing film of its year. She had further box-office successes with A Few Good Men (1992), Indecent Proposal (1993), and Disclosure (1994), and received $12.5 million to star in Striptease (1996), becoming the highest-paid actress to that point. Moore was considered to be one of the most bankable stars of the 1990s. 
Moore's career saw a downturn after the films The Scarlet Letter (1995), The Juror (1996), and G.I. Jane (1997) fell below commercial expectations. Since then, she has played roles in Passion of Mind (2000), Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle (2003), Bobby (2006), Mr. Brooks (2007), Flawless (2008), Margin Call (2011), and Blind (2017). Her television projects include If These Walls Could Talk (1996), Empire (2015–2017), Brave New World (2020), and Feud: Capote vs. The Swans (2024).
Moore has been married thrice. From 1981 to 1985, she was married to musician Freddy Moore. From 1987 to 2000, she was married to Bruce Willis, with whom she has three daughters. She was married to Ashton Kutcher from 2005 to 2013. Her memoir Inside Out (2019) became a New York Times Best Seller.


== Early life ==
Moore was born November 11, 1962, in Roswell, New Mexico. Her biological father, Air Force airman Charles Foster Harmon Sr., left her then-18-year-old mother, Virginia (née King), after a two-month marriage before Moore's birth. Charles came from Lanett, Alabama, and Virginia was born in Richmond, California, but had grown up in Roswell. Moore's maternal grandmother was raised on a farm in Elida, New Mexico. Moore has deep roots in the South Central and Southern United States, particularly Oklahoma, Arkansas and Georgia. When Moore was three months old, her mother married Dan Guynes, a newspaper advertising salesman who frequently changed jobs; as a result, the family moved many times. In 1967 they had Moore's half-brother Morgan. Moore said in 1991, "My dad is Dan Guynes. He raised me. There is a man who would be considered my biological father who I don't really have a relationship with." Moore has half-siblings from Charlie Harmon's other marriages, but she does not keep in touch with them either.
Moore's stepfather Dan Guynes married and divorced Virginia twice. On October 20, 1980, a year after their second divorce from each other, Guynes died by suicide. Her biological father Harmon died in 1997 from liver cancer in Brazoria, Texas. Moore's mother had a long arrest record which included drunk driving and arson. Moore broke off contact with her in 1989, when Guynes walked away halfway through a rehab stay Moore had financed at the Hazelden Foundation in Minnesota. Virginia Guynes posed nude for the magazine High Society in 1993, where she spoofed Moore's Vanity Fair pregnancy and bodypaint covers and parodied her clay scene from Ghost. Moore and Guynes reconciled shortly before Guynes died of a brain tumor on July 2, 1998.
Moore spent her early childhood in Roswell, and later, Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. Bob Gardner, a photographer for the Monongahela Daily Herald when Dan Guynes was head of advertising, recalled that Moore "looked malnourished and not so much abused as neglected. That haunting look as a child made me feel uneasy." She suffered from strabismus, which was corrected by two operations, as well as kid
