Wanted Dead or Alive is an American Western television series starring Steve McQueen as bounty hunter Josh Randall. It aired on CBS for three seasons from 1958–1961. The black-and-white program was a spin-off of a March 1958 episode of Trackdown, a 1957–1959 Western series starring Robert Culp. Both series were produced by Vincent Fennelly for Four Star Television in association with CBS.: 895 
The series made McQueen, known for the concept of "cool" in entertainment, a television star.: 105  He later became the first TV star to cross over into comparable status on the big screen.


== Synopsis ==

Josh Randall is a Confederate veteran and bounty hunter with a soft heart. He often donates his earnings to the needy, and helps his prisoners if they have been wrongly accused.
Although Randall is a bounty hunter, he doesn't only chase and capture men on wanted posters. He also settles a family feud, frees unjustly jailed or sentenced men, helps an amnesia victim recover his memory, and finds missing husbands, sons, fathers, a fiancée, a suitor, a daughter who had been captured many years earlier by Indians, an Army deserter, a pet sheep, and even Santa Claus. This variety, as well as his pursuit of justice and not just money, contributed to the show's attraction and popularity.: 52 
Except for a few episodes at the beginning of the series, Randall rode an energetic horse named Ringo.: 88 
Beginning with the 1959 episode, "Amos Carter", actor Wright King would appear in a supporting role as Jason Nichols, an eager young deputy sheriff turned bounty hunter. By the start of the third season, Nichols had been dropped. The episode, "The Partners", in which Nichols killed three men who Randall felt could have been taken alive, is often considered the episode that broke up the partnership, although that was actually only the second episode with Wright King and long before the last episode he appeared in.

Three hard mother-grabbin' years, but I learned my trade and it gave me discipline.

Vincent Fennelly and Four Star Television were considering a spinoff of their current series, Trackdown, which itself was a spinoff of Zane Grey Theater. At the time, McQueen's manager, Hillard Elkins, was also representing Trackdown star Robert Culp. Elkins knew of the spinoff plan and suggested McQueen for the role.: 83  McQueen's style was exactly what Fennelly was looking for to fill the role.  Initially not interested in doing Westerns, McQueen agreed to the role based on his ability to connect with Fennelly and his vision for the role of Randall.: 258–259  The pilot was filmed before McQueen did The Blob in 1958.: 83 
Four Star founder, Dick Powell, was initially hesitant about McQueen in the lead role due to McQueen's short stature, as well as his inability to ride horses, but he changed his mind after seeing early clips of the first episode.: 50  It was Powell's idea to give the character of Josh Randall a gimmick weapon.: 50 
Prior to initial filming, Steve McQueen did not know how to ride horses and was forced to learn for the show's production.: 50 
McQueen had a reputation for being difficult to work with, and he fired three stunt men within the first day's filming, including Richard Farnsworth. Ultimately, that job went to Loren Janes, who also doubled for McQueen in a number of movies.
Although the show and its episodes are fiction, bounty hunters were common in the American West, and there is some historical basis for the stories.: 258 
McQueen's initial salary for the show was $750 per episode, but due to the show's popularity, that climbed to $100,000 per year, which was extremely high for the time.: 259 : 52  The time slot change for the third season that ultimately rui
