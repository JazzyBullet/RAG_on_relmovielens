Ciao, Professore! (lit. 'Hello, Professor!'; original title: "Io speriamo che me la cavo", which is a grammatically erroneous phrase meaning "Let's hope that I scrape by (the Judgement Day)" taken from Raffaele's homework essay) is a 1992 Italian "fish out of water" comedy film about an elementary school teacher from northern Italy who is sent by mistake to an impoverished town in the Naples region of southern Italy. There he must deal with vast cultural differences and teach chronically truant children who only respect violence and power, especially one young boy who is already caught up in the gangster lifestyle. The film was directed by Lina Wertmüller and stars Paolo Villaggio.
