Mononoke (モノノ怪) is a Japanese anime television series produced by Toei Animation. A spin-off of 2006's horror anthology series Ayakashi: Samurai Horror Tales, Mononoke  follows the character of the medicine seller as he continues to face a myriad of  supernatural perils. Mononoke takes place between the end of the Edo period  and Meiji era of Japan with the four class system, Samurai being the highest class and merchants (such as the medicine seller himself) being in the lowest class. Only Samurai were permitted to carry swords, which is why it comes as a shock to many of the characters that the medicine seller would be carrying a sword.
