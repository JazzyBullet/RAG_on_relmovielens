Milly (born Carla Mignone; 26 February 1905 – 22 September 1980) was an Italian singer, actress and cabaret performer.


== Biography ==
Her father abandoned her family in 1910 and she was brought up by her mother. She was the sister of Italian comedian Totò Mignone, with whom, along with her sister Mity, she performed as a child. As a teenager she worked at the Teatro Fiandra where she debuted as a singer in 1925. During this time, Prince Umberto di Savoia fell in love with her. Her sister, Mity Mignone, married Mario Mattoli.
She moved to the U.S. before World War II but returned to Italy after the war's end. She performed in The Threepenny Opera at the Piccolo Teatro in Milan directed by Giorgio Strehler. She recorded many albums in a variety of languages, and appeared in numerous films, mostly Italian, but also including The Girl from Scotland Yard (1937) and Gidget Goes to Rome (1963), as well as the Mario Bava cult horror classic I tre volti della paura (in the U.S. Black Sabbath; 1963), with Boris Karloff.
