The Falcon and the Snowman is a 1985 American spy drama film directed by John Schlesinger. The screenplay by Steven Zaillian is based on the 1979 book The Falcon and the Snowman: A True Story of Friendship and Espionage by Robert Lindsey, and tells the true story of two young American men, Christopher Boyce (Timothy Hutton) and Andrew Daulton Lee (Sean Penn), who sold US security secrets to the Soviet Union.
The film's original music was performed by the Pat Metheny group, and featured singer David Bowie on "This Is Not America".
The film was a muted success at the box office, but received rave reviews for the performances of Penn and Hutton.
