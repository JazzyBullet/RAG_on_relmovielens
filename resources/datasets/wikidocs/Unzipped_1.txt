Unzipped is a 1995 American documentary film directed by Douglas Keeve. It follows fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi, Keeve's then boyfriend, as he plans and ultimately shows his fall 1994 collection. The film put such a rift in their relationship over Mizrahi's depiction that the two broke up over it.
There are appearances by supermodels Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss, as well as many other celebrities and designers from the fashion world and beyond. At the 1995 Sundance Film Festival, it won the Audience Award for U.S. Documentary, tied with Ballot Measure 9.
