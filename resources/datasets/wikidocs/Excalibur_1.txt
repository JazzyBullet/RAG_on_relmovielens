Excalibur is the mythical sword of King Arthur that may possess magical powers or be  associated with the rightful sovereignty of Britain. Traditionally, the sword in the stone that is the proof of Arthur's lineage and the sword given to him by a Lady of the Lake are not the same weapon, even as in some versions of the legend both of them share the name of Excalibur.  Several similar swords and other weapons also appear within Arthurian texts, as well as in other legends.
