The Official Story (Spanish: La historia oficial) is a 1985 Argentine historical drama film directed by Luis Puenzo and written by Puenzo and Aída Bortnik. It stars Norma Aleandro, Héctor Alterio, Chunchuna Villafañe and Hugo Arana. In the United Kingdom, it was released as The Official Version.
The film deals with the story of an upper middle class couple who lives in Buenos Aires with an illegally adopted child. The mother comes to realize that her daughter may be the child of a desaparecida, a victim of the forced disappearances that occurred during Argentina's last military dictatorship (1976–1983), which saw widespread human rights violations including many thousands of murders.
Among several other international awards, it won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film at the 58th Academy Awards, a first for a Latin American film.
It was selected as the eighth greatest Argentine film of all time in a poll conducted by the Museo del Cine Pablo Ducrós Hicken in 2000. In a new version of the survey organized in 2022 by the specialized magazines La vida util, Taipei and La tierra quema, presented at the Mar del Plata International Film Festival, the film reached the 28 position. Also in 2022, the film was included in Spanish magazine Fotogramas's list of the 20 best Argentine films of all time.
