A chauffeur (French pronunciation: [ʃofœʁ]) is a person employed to drive a passenger motor vehicle, especially a luxury vehicle such as a large sedan or a limousine.
Originally, such drivers were often personal employees of the vehicle owner, but this has changed to specialist chauffeur service companies or individual drivers that provide both driver and vehicle for hire. Some service companies merely provide the driver.
