The Flipper Zero is a portable multi-functional device developed for interaction with access control systems. The device is able to read, copy, and emulate RFID and NFC tags, radio remotes, iButton, and digital access keys, along with a GPIO interface. It was first announced in August 2020 through the Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign, which raised $4.8 million. The first devices were delivered to backers 18 months after completion of the crowdfunding campaign. The device's user interface embodies a pixel-art dolphin virtual pet. The interaction with the virtual pet is the device's core game mechanic. The usage of the device's functions defines the appearance and emotions of the pet.
In the built-in game, the main mechanism to "upgrade" the dolphin is to use the various hacking tools. While harmless uses (like as a remote control for a television, or carbon dioxide sensor) exist, some of the built-in tools have potential criminal uses, including RFID skimming, bluetooth spamming (spamming a bluetooth connection, crashing a person's phone), and emulation of RFID chips such as those found in identification badges, using the built-in radio cloner to open garage doors, unlocking cars, and functioning as a wireless BadUSB. The device has been removed for sale from Amazon.com.
