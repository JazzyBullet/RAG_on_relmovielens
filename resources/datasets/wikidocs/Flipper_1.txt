The Flipper Zero is a portable multi-functional device developed for interaction with access control systems. The device is able to read, copy, and emulate RFID and NFC tags, radio remotes, iButton, and digital access keys, along with a GPIO interface. It was first announced in August 2020 through the Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign, which raised $4.8 million. The first devices were delivered to backers 18 months after completion of the crowdfunding campaign. The device's user interface embodies a pixel-art dolphin virtual pet. The interaction with the virtual pet is the device's core game mechanic. The usage of the device's functions defines the appearance and emotions of the pet.
In the built-in game, the main mechanism to "upgrade" the dolphin is to use the various hacking tools. While harmless uses (like as a remote control for a television, or carbon dioxide sensor) exist, some of the built-in tools have potential criminal uses, including RFID skimming, bluetooth spamming (spamming a bluetooth connection, crashing a person's phone), and emulation of RFID chips such as those found in identification badges, using the built-in radio cloner to open garage doors, unlocking cars, and functioning as a wireless BadUSB. The device has been removed for sale from Amazon.com.


== Origin ==
The device was developed by Alex Kulagin and Pavel Zhovner in 2019. They started raising funds on Kickstarter.


== Overview ==
Flipper Zero is designed for interaction with various types of access control systems, radio protocols, RFID, near-field communication (NFC), and infrared signals. To operate the device, it is not required to have a computer or a smartphone; it can be controlled via a 5-position D-pad and a separate back button. Flipper Zero has a monochrome orange backlight LCD screen with a resolution of 128x64 pixels. For connection with external modules, the device has general-purpose input/output (GPIO) pinholes on the top side. User data and firmware updates are stored on a Micro SD card. Some actions, such as firmware or user data update, require a connection to a computer or a smartphone with developer's software installed.
In July 2023 an app store was opened for the device.


== Technical specification ==
The electronic schematics and firmware of the Flipper Zero project are open sourced under the GNU General Public License. At the same time, the device does not fit into the open-source hardware category because the printed circuit boards are not open-sourced, which does not allow enthusiasts to make their own copies of the device without knowledge of electrical engineering.


=== Hardware ===

Flipper Zero is based on a dual-core ARM architecture STM32WB55 microcontroller, which has 256 KB of RAM and 1 MB of Flash storage. The first core is a 64 MHz Cortex-M4 which runs the main firmware. The second core is a 32 MHz Cortex-M0 which runs STMicroelectronics proprietary firmware that implements the Bluetooth Low Energy protocol. For radio transmitting and receiving in the 300â€“900 MHz radio frequency range, a Texas Instruments CC1101 chip is used, which supports amplitude-shift keying (ASK) and frequency-shift keying (FSK) modulations. Unlike software-defined radio, the CC1101 chip cannot capture raw radio signals. This limitation requires the user to pre-configure the modulation parameters before receiving a radio signal, otherwise the signal will be received incorrectly.


==== Hardware expansion ====
In February 2024 a video game module was released for the Flipper Zero by its makers. The device allows the Flipper to be used as a game controller or connected to a TV and is based around the Raspberry Pi Pico.


=== Firmware ===

The Flipper Zero firmware is based on the FreeRTOS operating system, with its own software abstraction over the hardware layer. The firmware is mostly written in the C programming language, with occasional use of C++ in third-party modules. The system uses multitasking in combination with an event-drive
