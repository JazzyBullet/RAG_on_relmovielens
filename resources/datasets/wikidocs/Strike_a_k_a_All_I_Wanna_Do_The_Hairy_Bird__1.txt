All I Wanna Do (originally titled The Hairy Bird) is a 1998 American comedy film written and directed by Sarah Kernochan. It stars Kirsten Dunst, Gaby Hoffmann, Monica Keena, Heather Matarazzo and Rachael Leigh Cook in an ensemble cast as students of the fictional Miss Godard's Preparatory School for Girls, and Lynn Redgrave as the school's headmistress. The film takes place in 1963 and focuses on several students' plotting and sabotage of a proposed merger for the school to go coed.
Originally titled The Hairy Bird, the film's screenplay, set in 1963, is based loosely on Kernochan's experiences at Rosemary Hall around that time. Filming was done in Toronto, Ontario, Canada at the Trafalgar Castle School in Whitby. The song "The Hairy Bird" plays during the film's end credits; it was written by Kernochan and sung by a group which includes Kernochan and five of her Rosemary Hall classmates, including Glenn Close.
The film was given a limited release on September 4, 1998, in the United States under the title All I Wanna Do (as its American distributor Miramax Films found the original title too offensive), and was then acquired by Buena Vista Home Entertainment who released it straight-to-video. In Canada and the United Kingdom (as well as for later streaming distribution in the U.S.), it was released under the title Strike!.
