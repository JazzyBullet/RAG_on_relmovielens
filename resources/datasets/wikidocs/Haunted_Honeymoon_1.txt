Haunted Honeymoon is a 1986 American comedy horror film starring Gene Wilder, Gilda Radner, Dom DeLuise and Jonathan Pryce. Wilder also served as writer and director. The title Haunted Honeymoon was previously used for the 1940 U.S. release of Busman's Honeymoon based on the stage play by Dorothy L. Sayers.
Honeymoon was distributed by Orion Pictures through a deal with HBO. The film flopped  by grossing just short of its $9 million budget, whilst it was panned by the critics.
