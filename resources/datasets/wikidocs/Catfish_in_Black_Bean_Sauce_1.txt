The film has received mixed reviews. A Los Angeles Times review noted that as the film's writer/director/actor Chi Muoi Lo "spread himself too thin, resulting in an uneven picture but one that has plenty of substance and emotion". Roger Ebert wrote that the film was "a first draft for a movie that could have been extraordinary". The San Francisco Chronicle noted that the film was "a comedy of interracial wariness and misunderstanding marked by a refreshing lack of sappiness".
