The James Dean Story is a 1957 American documentary.
Released two years after Dean's death, the Warner Bros. Pictures release chronicles his short life and career through black-and-white still photographs, interviews with the aunt and uncle who raised him, his paternal grandparents, a New York City cabdriver friend, and the owner of his favorite Los Angeles restaurant, and outtakes from East of Eden, footage of the opening night of Giant, and Dean's public service announcement for safe driving from Warner Bros. Presents.
Martin Gabel's narration was written by Stewart Stern, who scripted Dean's Rebel Without a Cause. A directing credit was shared by Robert Altman and George W. George.
