Anne Rice's Interview with the Vampire, or simply Interview with the Vampire, is an American gothic horror television series developed by Rolin Jones for AMC, based on the 1976 novel and elements from The Vampire Chronicles by Anne Rice. The series stars Jacob Anderson as Louis de Pointe du Lac and Sam Reid as Lestat de Lioncourt and begins with the vampire Louis recounting his past life and tumultuous relationship with the vampire Lestat. The series embraces the queer elements of Rice's work, which are only insinuated in the 1994 film adaptation of the novel, and deals with themes such as race and abuse. It is the first series set in the Immortal Universe, a shared universe based on Rice's novels.
Interview with the Vampire received a series order in June 2021, after AMC Networks purchased the rights to intellectual property encompassing 18 of Rice's novels in 2020. The series was renewed for an eight-episode second season in September 2022, ahead of the premiere of its first season on October 2, 2022. The second season premiered on May 12, 2024.
The series received positive reviews from critics, with praise going towards the writing, costumes, soundtrack, production design, lead performances and their chemistry.
