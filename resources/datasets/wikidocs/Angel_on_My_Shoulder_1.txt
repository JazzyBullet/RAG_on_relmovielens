Angel on My Shoulder is a 1946 American supernatural film starring Paul Muni, Anne Baxter and Claude Rains. The plot involves a deal between the Devil and a dead man. It was directed by Archie Mayo (as his last film).
The film was an independent production produced by Charles R. Rogers and David W. Siegel, written by Harry Segall and Roland Kibbee and released by United Artists.
The producer changed the original title of Me and Satan, concerned that the public would not see a film about the devil.
