The Toxic Avenger Part III: The Last Temptation of Toxie is a 1989 American superhero comedy splatter film and the third installment of The Toxic Avenger franchise. It was directed by Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz.
The title is a play on that of the 1988 film The Last Temptation of Christ. In the film, the depressed Toxic Avenger needs to secure sufficient funds for his girlfriend's surgery. He agrees to work for a corrupt chemical corporation, and settles into a yuppie lifestyle. Until he realizes that his boss is the Devil, who challenges him into a video game-inspired duel.
