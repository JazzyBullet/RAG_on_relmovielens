The Gnome-Mobile is a 1967 American fantasy comedy film directed by Robert Stevenson and produced by Walt Disney Productions. Based on the 1936 book The Gnomobile by Upton Sinclair, it was one of the last films personally supervised by Walt Disney. Walter Brennan is dual cast as D.J. Mulrooney, the kind-hearted lumber tycoon of Irish descent, and as the irascible 943-year-old gnome Knobby. The film crosses genres "between a comedy, a romance, a drama, and an environmental critique". Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber, previously the Banks children in Mary Poppins (1964), portray Mulrooney's grandchildren Elizabeth and Rodney. Tom Lowell, as the gnome Jasper, Richard Deacon, and Sean McClory round out the cast.
Richard and Robert Sherman contributed the title song. The film marked the final roles for both Matthew Garber and Ed Wynn. The Gnome-Mobile was re-released theatrically on November 5, 1976.
