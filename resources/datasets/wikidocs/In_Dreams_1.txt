Dreams, Dreams, Dreams  is the sixth album by the Canadian rock band Chilliwack.  This was the eighth album (including two as The Collectors) done by the band's core of Bill Henderson, Glenn Miller and Ross Turney, and the third with Howard Froese.  After Chilliwack's failure to find an audience with Rockerbox, this album (with the same lineup) marked the band's return to the top 10 in Canada with "Fly at Night" (which also charted in the US, at #75), while "California Girl" and "Baby Blue" were also Top 40 hits there.  "Rain-O" was a remake of Chilliwack's first hit. Dreams, Dreams, Dreams was the first Canadian Platinum album for the band.
According to Bill Henderson's liner notes from the 2013 reissue, the band members at this time were all Scientologists, and the back of the album contains a dedication to L. Ron Hubbard.
