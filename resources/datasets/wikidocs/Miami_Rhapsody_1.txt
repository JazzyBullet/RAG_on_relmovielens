== Plot ==
Gwyn Marcus (Sarah Jessica Parker) is in her late twenties and has always wanted a marriage like her parents. She has just accepted the proposal of her boyfriend Matt (Gil Bellows), but she has some misgivings about their future together. Her fear of commitment grows as she learns of the various affairs that her family is having. At first, her sister Leslie (Carla Gugino) gets married. Then, six months later, she starts an affair with her old high-school boyfriend, due to her husband's cheapness, despite making a big salary, and constant busy schedule with his football career. Her brother Jordan (Kevin Pollak), already married, starts an affair with his business partner's wife, due to the missing passion between him and his wife, after giving birth to their first child. Her mother (Mia Farrow) is growing concerned about Gwyn's being the last single person in the family, despite the fact that she is also having an affair with her mother's (Gwyn's grandmother's) nurse, Antonio (Antonio Banderas), due to the constant arguments between her and her father, including the fact that he also had an affair with an insane travel agent. But the more she thinks about marriage, the more she must search for the balance between career, marriage, and family.
