A River Runs Through It and Other Stories is a semi-autobiographical collection of three stories by American author Norman Maclean (1902â€“1990) published in 1976. It was the first work of fiction published by the University of Chicago Press.
The collection contains the novella "A River Runs Through It" and two short stories, "Logging and Pimping and 'Your pal, Jim'" and "USFS 1919: The Ranger, the Cook, and a Hole in the Sky", which precede the events of the novella. It received widespread acclaim upon its publication and was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize in Letters in 1977, but the selection committee ultimately did not award the prize in that category that year. Two of the stories were later adapted into feature films.
