"Blame It on Lisa" is the fifteenth episode of the thirteenth season of the American animated television series The Simpsons.
Written by Bob Bendetson and directed by Steven Dean Moore, "Blame It on Lisa" features several references to popular culture, including a parody of the Brazilian children's television host Xuxa and an allusion to the film A Trip to the Moon. When it originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 31, 2002, it was seen by around eleven million people. In 2010, the episode was released on DVD and Blu-ray along with the rest of the episodes of the thirteenth season.
"Blame It on Lisa" attracted controversy in Brazil because of its inclusion of clich√©s and stereotypes, including frequent depictions of crime, slums and rat infestations, as well as cultural inaccuracies. Riotur, the tourist board of Rio de Janeiro, planned on taking legal action against Fox for damaging the international image of the city. James L. Brooks, executive producer of The Simpsons, soon issued an apology to Rio de Janeiro.
