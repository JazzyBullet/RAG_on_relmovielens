Films made in Japan produce revenue through various sources; the lists below only consider box office earnings at cinemas, not other sources of income such as merchandising or home video. The lists include both anime and live-action films produced by Japanese studios, but do not include English-language international co-productions between Japanese and Hollywood studios. For example, many Hollywood films based on Japanese source material, were coâ€‘produced with Japanese production companies.
