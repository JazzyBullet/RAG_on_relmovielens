Jagged Edge is an American R&B group from Atlanta, Georgia. The group, initially signed to record producer Jermaine Dupri's So So Def Recordings, is best known for their string of hit singles including "Let's Get Married" and "Where the Party At" (featuring Nelly), most of which were produced by Dupri. The group's members include identical twin lead singers Brian and Brandon Casey as well as Richard Wingo and Kyle Norman. The group's debut album, A Jagged Era (1997), performed modestly at the time of its release but achieved gold status; however, their subsequent albums until 2007 all became commercial successesâ€”debuting within the top 10 of the Billboard 200.
Wingo was a late addition to the group, added after a recommendation from Kandi Burruss of Xscape. Burruss was also the one who brought the group to the attention of Dupri, who signed them to his Columbia Records distributed imprint, So So Def Recordings. The name Jagged Edge is derived from the song "Snakes" by rapper Ol' Dirty Bastard's debut album Return to the 36 Chambers: The Dirty Version, more specifically, the beginning of RZA's verse, which states, "Jagged Edge, Rockhead God, hard as Stonehenge..."
