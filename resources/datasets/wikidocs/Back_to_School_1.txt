Kurt Vonnegut has a cameo as himself, as does the band Oingo Boingo, whose frontman Danny Elfman composed the score for the film.

The diving scenes were filmed at the since-demolished Industry Hills Aquatic Club in the City of Industry, California.

Thornton Meloni, a child of Italian immigrants, returns from school one day to his father's tailor shop, bearing a report card with poor grades. His ambition is to go into his father's line of work, but his stern father warns Thornton "If a man has no education, he's got nothing."
As decades pass, Thornton Anglicizes his surname to "Melon" and becomes a self-made corporate giant, with a successful chain of plus-size clothing stores and numerous other business ventures.
