Dead Poet Society is an American rock band formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 2013 by Jack Underkofler (vocals, guitar), Jack Collins (guitar), Nick Taylor (bass guitar) and Will Goodroad (drums). Dylan Brenner replaced Nick Taylor on bass in 2019. The band started off as an independent group, self-producing and self-recording their songs before signing to Spinefarm Music Group in 2018. They released their debut album -!- in 2021. In a 2016 interview with Beyond The Stage Magazine, frontman Jack Underkofler described the band's sound as "heavy indie rock" and "djent pop," contrasting heavy, down-tuned guitar riffs with soft, pop-adjacent choruses and verses.
The band was formed in 2013 while the members were attending the Berklee College of Music. They played their first concert two days after their founding, so they needed to come up with a name. They chose "Dead Poet Society" which is unrelated to the film Dead Poets Society. After graduation, the band moved to Los Angeles. They went on tour in Mexico, then they opened for Badflower which established their notability in the US.
