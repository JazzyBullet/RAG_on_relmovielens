== Plot ==
In Los Angeles, the lives of intertwining characters are shown. Among the characters are an older couple, who are about to renew their wedding vows; a theatre director and architect navigating a new beginning; a young woman looking for a good time; a gay man dying of AIDS and his mother who had not been close; a couple having an affair and her husband who is exploring ways to break through the staleness of their marriage.
As the stories evolve, the connections between the characters become evident.
Unhappily-married Hugh regularly hits on women with an array of lies: that he has killed his wife and son in a car accident; that his wife and kids leave him on the same day he is fired; and that he has cheated on his wife with her brother. Hugh runs into improv classmate Valery in a bar, telling her he performs better in real life than in class.
Paul, who is suffering a brain tumour, and Hannah are planning their 40th anniversary party and to renew their vows. Despite Hannah's best efforts, Paul refuses to address that he's dying. Hannah considers cancelling her televised cooking show, but Paul won't let her. When Hannah confronts Paul over a picture of another woman in his desk, he admits he never slept with her because he was in love with her.
Lonely theatre director Meredith dates architect Trent. Both are divorced; Meredith has been burnt many times before, and Trent still wears his wedding ring four years on. Trent convinces Meredith to invite him over and cook him dinner. Meredith panics once he arrives, first telling him they will not be having sex, then asking him to leave, saying it's to avoid the inevitable heartache. However Trent gets a do-over, and they connect at his place.
The spark has gone from Gracie's marriage, who deals with this by meeting her lover Roger in hotel rooms before returning home to distant husband Hugh.

Twenty-something clubber Joan flirts with Keenan after having a very final, vocal breakup with her ex via payphone. After complaining how terrible her relationship was, Joan propositions Keenan to see a film only to be rebuffed as he 'doesn't date'. Even so, Keenan turns up at the movies as Joan proposes. Joan and Keenan admit their feelings. He reveals his former girlfriend contracted AIDS from sharing needles and died, and that, as a result, he is HIV-positive. Promising to be careful, they start a relationship.
Mildred calls Meredith for Mark's funeral, as he was her high school sweetheart, then husband, who left her for a man. Returning home with Mildred, Meredith goes next door to her parents' - Hannah and Paul's - where the anniversary preparations are well on their way. Sister Gracie appears to help, and little sister Joan breezes in at the last moment.
