"Be Faithful" is a song performed by American rapper Fatman Scoop, featuring and produced by American hip hop duo the Crooklyn Clan. The song was released in March 1999, becoming a minor hit in the US. A second release in October 2003 gained the song wider international success. "Be Faithful" topped the charts in Ireland and the United Kingdom in 2003, and peaked within the top 10 of the charts in Australia and Denmark. The song was featured in the trailer for the film The Best Man and later in the film Save the Last Dance.
The song heavily samples "Love Like This" by Faith Evans, which in turn is made of a covered loop from Chic's "Chic Cheer". It also samples "Party Ain't a Party" by Queen Pen, "Off the Books" by the Beatnuts, "Can I Get A..." by Jay-Z, "Hip Hop Hooray" by Naughty by Nature and "The Choice Is Yours (Revisited)" by Black Sheep.
Two decades after its release, the song re-gained attention in 2018 after Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison posted a tweet, containing footage of Parliament set to an excerpt of the song. It was criticized for its inappropriate lyrics and potential breach of laws on the use of Parliamentary footage.
