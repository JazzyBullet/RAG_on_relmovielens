Tommy Boy is a 1995 American buddy comedy film directed by Peter Segal, written by Bonnie and Terry Turner, produced by Lorne Michaels, and starring former Saturday Night Live castmates and close friends Chris Farley and David Spade. The first of many films that Segal has filmed with former SNL castmates, it tells the story of a socially and emotionally immature man (Farley) who learns lessons about friendship and self-worth, following the sudden death of his industrialist father.
Shot primarily in Toronto and Los Angeles under the working title Rocky Road, Tommy Boy received mixed reviews from critics and was a commercial disappointment, grossing $32.7 million on a budget of $20 million. Since its release, however, Tommy Boy has become a cult film and also been successful on home video.
