Super Crooks is a Japanese-American original net anime series based on the 2012 comic book series of the same name by Mark Millar and Leinil Francis Yu. The series was written by Dai Sat≈ç and Tsukasa Kondo, and premiered on Netflix on November 25, 2021. Following small-time crook Johnny Bolt as he recruits a team of eight super-villains to perform a super-powered heist, the first nine episodes serve as a prequel to the comic book series, with the last three episodes adapting the comic outright. The series serves as a spin-off to Jupiter's Legacy (2021). In June 2021, a live-action Super Crooks series and second spin-off from the simultaneously-cancelled Jupiter's Legacy was announced to be in active development.
