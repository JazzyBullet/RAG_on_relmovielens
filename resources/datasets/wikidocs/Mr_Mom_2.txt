== Content ==
The song is a moderate uptempo number in which the lead singer describes his attempts to be "Mr. Mom" — i.e., a stay-at-home father attempting to raise his children while his wife is at work.


== Music video ==
The music video is a cartoon set in Nashville portraying a baby and a couple of kids, and features scenes in sync with the lyrics. When the kids' mother comes back home from work, she finds her husband tied up by the kids. Angered, she sends them (including the baby) upstairs. After the song ends, the father brings a diaper to an outside trash can, as a bus with the band’s name drives by with the baby on board, turning the background into live action, but still leaving the characters as a cartoon. Shocked, the father screams as the video fades out. The music video was directed by Roman White and Revolution Pictures.
