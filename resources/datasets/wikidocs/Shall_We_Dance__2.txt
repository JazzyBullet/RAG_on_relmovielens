Shall We Dance? (Japanese: Shall we ダンス?, Hepburn: Sharu wī dansu) is a 1996 Japanese romantic comedy-drama film directed by Masayuki Suo. Its title refers to the song "Shall We Dance?" which comes from Rodgers and Hammerstein's The King and I. It inspired the 2004 English-language remake of the same name.
