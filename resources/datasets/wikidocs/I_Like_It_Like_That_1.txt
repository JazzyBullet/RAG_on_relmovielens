I Like It Like That is a 1994 American comedy-drama film about the trials and tribulations of a young Puerto Rican man and an Afro–Puerto Rican (half-Jamaican, half-Puerto Rican) American woman living in a poverty-stricken New York City neighborhood in the South Bronx. The film stars Lauren Velez, Jon Seda, Lisa Vidal, Griffin Dunne, Jesse Borrego and Rita Moreno, and was written and directed by Darnell Martin who, in her filmmaking debut, became the first African-American female filmmaker to take helm of a film produced by a major film studio.
The film was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival.
