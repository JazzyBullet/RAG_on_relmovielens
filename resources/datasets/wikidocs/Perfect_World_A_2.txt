Perfect World Co., Ltd. (Chinese: 完美世界股份有限公司) is a Chinese mass media company based in Beijing. It was founded in 2004 by Chi Yufeng. The company consists of two business segments: Perfect World Games, a video game publisher, and Perfect World Pictures, a film production company.
Perfect World is the exclusive distributor of Valve's games Dota 2 and Counter-Strike 2 in China.


== History ==
Perfect World was founded in 2004 by Chi Yufeng. A 1994 graduate of Tsinghua University, Chi had founded Beijing Hongen Education and Technology in 1996, which sold educational software to teach Chinese consumers how to use personal computers and learn English. He established Perfect World, then also known as Perfect World Games, as a developer and publisher of online multiplayer video games. The company became listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange in 2007. In 2008, Chi founded the film production company Perfect World Pictures. After Perfect World Games was delisted from Nasdaq in 2015, it was merged with Perfect World Pictures, which was traded on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, in 2016. The combined company was renamed Perfect World. Perfect World Investment & Holding Group (Chinese: 完美世界控股集团有限公司), a holding company founded by Chi on 14 August 2013, owns a controlling interest in Perfect World.
Perfect World bought the developer Cryptic Studios from Atari, SA in May 2011 for €35 million. The transaction was completed by August that year.
Perfect World Entertainment was Perfect World's North American video game subsidiary. It was established in June 2008.
Perfect World sold Perfect World Entertainment and Cryptic Studios to Embracer Group into their The Gearbox Entertainment Company subsidiary. Perfect World Entertainment would rename itself into Gearbox Publishing San Francisco before eventually rebranding into Arc Games after Gearbox's sale to Take-Two Interactive, while Cryptic Studios was moved to DECA Games.


== Subsidiaries ==


=== Perfect World Europe ===
Perfect World Europe B.V. is Perfect World's European video game subsidiary. It was established in early 2010 in Amsterdam. Gabriel Hacker was appointed as Perfect World Europe's general manager in May 2012. In early 2020, a large portion of the company's staff was laid off, leaving only the finance, customer support, and localisation departments. The subsidiary formerly owned Perfect World Entertainment, the publishing arm of the company which was sold to Embracer Group in 2021.


=== Runic Games ===

Runic Games was a developer founded in 2008 and based in Seattle. Perfect World acquired a controlling interest in the studio in May 2010 for US$8.4 million. On 3 November 2017, Perfect World shut down Runic Games, citing the publisher's focus on games as a service.


== Collaborations with Valve ==
On 25 February 2016, Perfect World hosted Dota 2's Shanghai Major. While the tournament itself was well received in regards to the player performances, the event garnered criticism due to delays on stream, spotty broadcasts, and various other problems within the tournament, including the theft and deterioration of the competing teams' equipment. In the month that followed the event, the president of Perfect World, Yunfan Zhang, apologised for the issues with the event.
In June 2018, Perfect World and Valve announced that they were developing a version of Valve's Steam service for the Chinese market.
