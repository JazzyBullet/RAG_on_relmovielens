The Odd Couple II is a 1998 American buddy comedy film and the sequel to the 1968 film The Odd Couple. It was the final film written and produced by Neil Simon, and starring Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. Released nearly three decades later, it is unique among sequels for having one of the longest gaps between the release of both films in which all leads return. The Odd Couple II premiered on April 10, 1998, and was a critical and commercial failure, grossing less than half than its predecessor at the box office.
