Twenty-seven feature films have been released based on the manga and anime series Detective Conan (名探偵コナン, Meitantei Konan), known as Case Closed in North America. The first seven were directed by Kenji Kodama, films eight to fourteen were directed by Yasuichiro Yamamoto, films fifteen to twenty-one were directed by Kobun Shizuno, film twenty-two and twenty-six were directed by Yuzuru Tachikawa, films twenty-three, twenty-four, and twenty-seven were directed by Chika Nagaoka, and film twenty-five was directed by Susumu Mitsunaka. The films have been released in April of each year starting in 1997, excluding 2020. Each film features an original plotline rather than being an adaptation of the manga's story. Two film comics were released for each film. Funimation Entertainment released an English dubbed version of the first six films retaining the same name and story changes as its main Case Closed dub. Bang Zoom! Entertainment now releases English dubs of Case Closed films through Discotek Media, starting with the Episode One TV special.
