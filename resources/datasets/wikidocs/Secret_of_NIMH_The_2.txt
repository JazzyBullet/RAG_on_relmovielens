Mrs. Brisby is a fictional field mouse and the protagonist of the 1982 animated adventure film The Secret of NIMH, directed by Don Bluth. Adapted from the 1971 children's novel, Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH, in which she is originally named "Mrs. Frisby", she is voiced by Elizabeth Hartman in her final film role, who, by her own accord, made the character sound shy and timid. She was originally named "Mrs. Frisby" during the production of the film, like the book character, but was renamed due to a trademark issue with Mattel's Frisbee.
In the 1982 film, Mrs. Brisby is a widowed mother of four children in a world inhabited by humans. She has to move her children to save them from a human-operated plow but also has to manage her son Timothy, who caught pneumonia and therefore must stay inside to recover from it. As a result, she seeks the "Rats of NIMH" to help relocate her children and home. Eventually, using a red amulet necklace that was given to her by the rat leader Nicodemus and powered by the wearer's courage, she rescues both from sinking in mud. 
Since her debut, Mrs. Brisby has been mostly positively received for her timid personality combined with her kindness and courage, with critics citing her as a unique representation of a mother character who braves through an actively hostile world to save her children. Unofficially, she is also referred to as "Mrs. Elizabeth Brisby" by fans in honor of her voice actress.
