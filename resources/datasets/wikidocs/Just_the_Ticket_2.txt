A number-one ticket holder is a person who holds membership ticket number 1 of a particular sporting club. Possession of the number one ticket is largely symbolic. The tradition of having a number one ticket holder is mainly observed in Australia. To increase the club's visibility and exposure, the ticket is sometimes presented to a famous person or former athlete.
