The Flying Saucer is a 1950 independently made American black-and-white science fiction spy film drama. It was written by Howard Irving Young, from an original story by Mikel Conrad, who also produced, directed, and stars with Pat Garrison and Hantz von Teuffen. The film was first distributed in the U.S. by Film Classics and later re-released in 1953 by Realart Pictures, on a double-bill with Atomic Monster (the retitled-reissue of Man Made Monster, originally released in 1941 by Universal Pictures).
The Flying Saucer is the first feature film to deal with the (then) new and hot topic of flying saucers. Flying saucers, or alien craft shaped like flying disks or saucers, were first identified and given the popular name on June 24, 1947, when private pilot Kenneth Arnold reported nine silvery, crescent-shaped objects flying in tight formation. A newspaper reporter coined the snappy tagline, "flying saucers", which captured the public's imagination.  During the 1947 flying disc craze, over 800 'copycat' sightings were reported throughout North America.
The film has no relationship and should not be confused with the later Ray Harryhausen science fiction film Earth vs. the Flying Saucers, released by Columbia Pictures.
