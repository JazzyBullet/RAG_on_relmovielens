Life Is Beautiful is the original soundtrack album, on the Virgin Records America label, of the 1997 Academy Award-winning film Life Is Beautiful (original title: La vita Ã¨ bella), starring Roberto Benigni (who won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as "Guido Orefice" in this film), Nicoletta Braschi and Giustino Durano. The original score was composed by Nicola Piovani, with the exception of a classical piece which figures prominently: the "Barcarolle" by Jacques Offenbach.
The album won the Academy Award for Best Original Dramatic Score and was nominated for a Grammy Award in Best Instrumental Composition Written For A Motion Picture, Television Or Other Visual Media, but lost to the score of A Bug's Life.
