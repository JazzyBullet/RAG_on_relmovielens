3 Strikes is a 2000 American comedy film written and directed by DJ Pooh, and starring Brian Hooks, N'Bushe Wright, Faizon Love and David Alan Grier. Despite some commercial success, it was negatively received by critics. The title refers to California's habitual offender law, whereby three convictions confer an automatic life sentence.
