MouseHunt is a passive browser game in which players, referred to as hunters, catch mice with a variety of traps to earn experience points and virtual gold. MouseHunt was developed by HitGrab, Inc. under the direction of Bryan Freeman and Joel Auge, and was released to a select group of beta testers in early 2007. On 7 March 2008, MouseHunt was officially released to the general public. Just nine months later, MouseHunt earned a $250,000 grant from Facebook's seed fund fbFund. In 2011, it was shortlisted by Facebook as a top game with 50,000 to 100,000 users. It was one of the first games on Facebook to introduce a tradeable digital good (SUPER|brie+).
MouseHunt released mobile apps for iOS on 17 October 2012 and Android on 7 December 2012.
