Single White Female is a 1992 American psychological erotic thriller film based on John Lutz's 1990 novel SWF Seeks Same. It stars Bridget Fonda and Jennifer Jason Leigh and was directed by Barbet Schroeder. It follows recently estranged Allison Jones (Fonda), who begins to rent an apartment room to Hedra Carlson (Leigh). After she reconciles with her ex-boyfriend, she begins to find strange patterns of behavior in her tenant. 
Despite its box office success, Single White Female received mixed reviews from critics, but both Fonda and Leigh received praise for their performances. It was also successful in the home video market, and finished in the top 10 video rentals of 1993. Released during the "golden age" of the erotic thriller, it became a cultural touchstone for later thrillers, and in subsequent years has become a cult film.
