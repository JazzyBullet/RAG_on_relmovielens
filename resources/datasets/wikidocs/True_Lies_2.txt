== Development ==
In September 2010, multiple websites reported that James Cameron, writer/director of the 1994 film, was developing and executive producing with Rae Sanchini, through Lightstorm Entertainment and 20th Television, a True Lies television series with Dark Angel producer René Echevarria serving as showrunner and producer. In 2017, Fox planned to do a pilot of the series, with Marc Guggenheim as screenwriter, McG as executive producer and possible director. In May 2019, McG announced on Collider Live that the television series would air on Disney+.
On February 10, 2021, CBS announced a pilot order for the second attempt at a True Lies series adaptation, with Matt Nix writing the pilot and producing with Josh Levy via Flying Glass of Milk Productions. Mary Viola of Wonderland Sound and Vision executive produced, with Corey Marsh of Wonderland co-executive producing. McG was set to direct the pilot and executive produce via Wonderland. In March 2021, CBS moved the pilot "off cycle" to give the series producers more time to film the pilot later in the year.
By May 2022, the series was revived, with Anthony Hemingway replacing McG as the director of the pilot and subsequent episodes, before CBS picked up the series to air in the 2022–2023 broadcast season. Steve Howey and Ginger Gonzaga were cast in the lead roles, while Erica Hernandez, Omar Miller, Mike O'Gorman, Annabella Didion, and Lucas Jaye round out the supporting roles.
By February 2023, Matthew Lillard, Keith David, Jackson Hurst, and Tom Connolly were confirmed to have guest roles, while Tom Arnold is set to return from the 1994 film.
On May 8, 2023, CBS canceled the series after one season.
