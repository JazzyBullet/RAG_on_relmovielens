The Final Destination (also known as Final Destination 4) is a 2009 American 3D supernatural horror film written by Eric Bress and directed by David R. Ellis. It is the fourth installment in the Final Destination film series and the second standalone sequel after Final Destination 3 (2006), and stars Bobby Campo, Shantel VanSanten, and Mykelti Williamson. Produced by New Line Cinema, the film follows a group of people after they escape a deadly accident during a stock car race, with Death stalking and killing them one by one.
After the commercial success of Final Destination 3, a fourth film entered in development and was planned to be in 3D, with Bress writing the script. The script impressed producer Craig Perry and New Line Cinema enough to green-light a fourth installment. James Wong was on board to direct, but because of scheduling conflicts, he decided to drop out. Consequently, the studio executives opted for David R. Ellis to return because of his work on Final Destination 2, who personally accepted because of the 3D. Filming began in March 2008 and ended late May in the same year.
The Final Destination was theatrically released on August 28, 2009, by Warner Bros. Pictures and New Line Cinema. It is the first film in the series to be shot in HD 3D, and is currently the highest-grossing Final Destination film, earning $187 million worldwide, but received generally negative reviews from critics. The fifth film in the franchise, Final Destination 5, was released in August 2011.
