The Return of Jafar (sometimes marketed as Aladdin: The Return of Jafar on re-release) is a 1994 American direct-to-video animated musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Pictures and Television. It is the first sequel to Disney's 1992 animated feature film, Aladdin, and serves as the pilot to the Aladdin animated television series (being an origin story of how the series began, as it took place before this film).
Released on May 20, 1994, in North America, it was the second Disney animated feature film sequel, after The Rescuers Down Under (1990), and the first Disney direct-to-video animated feature film. It also marked the first American direct-to-video animated feature film. Gilbert Gottfried, Jonathan Freeman, Scott Weinger, Frank Welker, Brad Kane and Linda Larkin reprise their roles from the first film, with Jason Alexander, Val Bettin, Liz Callaway and Dan Castellaneta joining in the cast.
Although the film received mixed-to-negative reviews, it sold 15 million VHS tapes, grossing more than $300 million on a budget of approximately $5 million, making it one of the best-selling films on home video.
