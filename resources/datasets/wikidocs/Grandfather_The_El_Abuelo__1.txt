Alejandra and Daniel are two kids who live in opposite worlds, but are united by friendship and dreams.
Alejandra is a sweet and tender girl who lives in a world of dreams full of gardens, beautiful dresses, many hats and fairy tales. She is a girl full of fantasies and desires of magical adventures, her parents are wealthy and Alejandra has everything she desires, but that world is far away from Daniel's, a child who has been orphaned, and has made the streets his home since the death of his mother. He is helpless and unknown to his relatives. Daniel only knows that his maternal grandfather never forgave his mother for marrying the wrong man.
Little Daniel, who lives with his dog "Anselmo", first meets don Joaquín, an old musician performer that has now become grumpy and solitary. Daniel believes that the two can be great friends, never imagining that Don Joaquín is actually his grandfather. Daniel then meets Alejandra and together begin to explore new worlds filled with fun, all thanks to don Joaquín who becomes their guide and teaches them the true meaning of friendship and how to remain children. Don Joaquín provides the children with love and affection while also teaching them to use their imagination to travel to strange worlds and to dream things the children have failed to do by solving problems that did not correspond to them.
Ultimately, Daniel and Don Joaquín find they are grandfather and grandson and follow their path together without Alejandra.
