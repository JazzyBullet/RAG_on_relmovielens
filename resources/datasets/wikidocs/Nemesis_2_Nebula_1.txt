== Synopsis ==
73 years after Alex failed, humans have lost the Cyborg Wars and they are now slaves to the cyborg masters. Rebel scientists have developed a new DNA strain which could signal the end of the cyborgs, and it is injected it into a pregnant volunteer.
When the cyborgs learn of the woman and her baby, both are listed for termination. To escape, she steals a cyborg ship and is transported back in time to East Africa in 1980, where the mother is killed but the baby is saved. It takes 20 years, but a cyborg bounty hunter named Nebula eventually locates the young woman, named Alex, and travels back in time to terminate her.

== Reception ==
One reviewer noted that the film appeared to have been an unrelated film involving aliens that was repurposed as a Nemesis sequel  and was critical of Price's performance, weak storyline and minimal relation to the original film, a theme that he later brought up in his review of the sequel.
