==== Main event ====
At Vengeance Day on February 4, Trick Williams, who was accompanied by Carmelo Hayes, failed to win the NXT Championship from Ilja Dragunov. After the match, Hayes attacked Williams with a steel chair, ending their partnership and turning heel in the process. On the following episode of NXT, Hayes revealed that he was the one who attacked Williams back in October 2023 and set his sights at Dragunov and the NXT Championship. On the February 27 episode of NXT, Tony D'Angelo told Dragunov that he is tired that the NXT Championship is being centered around Dragunov, Hayes and Williams, and that he was willing to earn a title shot at the NXT Championship. Dragunov accepted D'Angelo's proposal and NXT General Manager Ava set a match between Hayes and D'Angelo at Roadblock to determine a #1 contender to the NXT Championship at Stand & Deliver, which was won by D'Angelo. After the match, Williams made his return and attacked Hayes in the ring. The following week on NXT, Williams challenged Hayes to a match at Stand & Deliver, which was then made official. On March 28, Shawn Michaels announced that the match was given a main event spot at Stand & Deliver, making Hayes and Williams the first two Black men to main event Stand & Deliver and the first two Black men to main event a PLE since The Rock and Booker T at SummerSlam in 2001.


==== Undercard matches ====
