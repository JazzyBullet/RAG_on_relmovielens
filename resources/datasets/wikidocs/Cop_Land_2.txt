The Atlanta Public Safety Training Center, commonly known as Cop City, is a police and fire department training campus under construction in the South River Forest area of Dekalb County near Atlanta, Georgia, United States. Much of the land included in the plans was formerly part of the Old Atlanta Prison Farm, which was abandoned in 1995.
In 2021, the location was identified by the City of Atlanta as the only suitable location to build the training center. This resulted in the development of Stop Cop City, a multi-faceted movement opposing the construction of the training center. In January 2023, Manuel Esteban Paez Terán, a member of the Stop Cop City movement, was fatally shot by Atlanta police. Following the shooting, law enforcement accused Terán of firing at officers; however, this is disputed by Terán's family. Protesters affiliated with the Stop Cop City movement were arrested in late 2022 and early 2023 and charged with domestic terrorism offenses; the validity of these charges has been called into question and created a nationwide controversy.
