== Reception ==
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 22% base on reviews from 9 critics.
Emanuel Levy wrote: "A highlight of 1997 Slamdance Film Fest, this raunchy romantic comedy has a nice premiseâ€”a Romeo who won't take no as an answer--but no narrative or plot to speak of, though two leads are charming and Keri Russell shows potential to become a star." He gave it a grade C.
David Cornelius of DVDTalk.com called it "Clumsy but delightful" and gave it 3 out of 5.
