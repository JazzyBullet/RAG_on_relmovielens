== History ==

In 1841, William and Nicolasa Workman, who emigrated from Mexico with John Rowland and others, received a land grant for Rancho La Puente from the governor of Alta California, Juan Bautista Alvarado. The ranch eventually grew to almost 49,000 acres. The Workmans quickly established themselves as cattle ranchers and did well financially during the Gold Rush, supplying fresh beef to the gold fields. Following the discovery of oil by their son on land they owned in the Montebello hills, the Workmans' grandson, Walter P. Temple, and his wife, Laura, bought the Workman House and surrounding land in 1917. This property is now known as the Workman and Temple Family Homestead Museum and is a museum and heritage site in present-day City of Industry that is free and open to the public. In the 1910s, Tract 1343 was created and shows a large portion of 2017's City boundaries.
In the late 19th and early 20th century, both the Southern Pacific and Union Pacific Railroad were built through the San Jose Creek valley in what is now Industry.  The Union Pacific would establish a major railyard at the Marne siding in what is now Industry.  Valley Boulevard, a major artery connecting Los Angeles with points east, was also laid through what would become the City of Industry.  The presence of the railroads and Valley Boulevard would lead to the development of warehouses that became a large part of Industry's economy.   
The City of Industry was incorporated as a charter city on June 18, 1957. A little under fifteen years from its incorporation, the City of Industry created a general plan to guide its future development. The 1971 document remains in effect as of 2020, nearly a half century later. The plan was overseen by planning consultants Gruen Associates, a firm established in 1950 by Austrian-born Victor Gruen, a visionary architect and urban planner.
The City's first mayor, John Ferrero (1912â€“1996), was elected to the City Council at Industry's incorporation, and served in such capacity for 39 years, becoming the longest serving mayor in California.
The City of Industry was named for the goals and objectives section of the general plan which identified the primary goal of the city as "creating and maintaining an ideal setting for manufacturing, distribution and industrial facilities."
In 1962, the City of Industry Chamber of Commerce formed and in 1974, the Workman House became a historical landmark. 
In 1979/1980 a former landfill near Azusa Avenue was converted into the Industry Hills Golf Club, including a hotel and the Eisenhower golf course. 
In 1981, the Industry Hills Expo Center opened as a community multi-purpose event facility.
In 1985, the inaugural Charity Pro Rodeo took place, to raise funds for youth in the San Gabriel Valley. The Rodeo still takes place annually. In 1991, in partnership with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, the Youth Activities League was formed to offer sports to at-risk children as an alternative to gang activity.
In recognition of the importance of mass transit, the city invested heavily in the development of a Metrolink transit station near the confluence of the 60 and 57 freeways and in 1993, the City of Industry Metrolink Station opened. In 2004, the Environmental Impact
