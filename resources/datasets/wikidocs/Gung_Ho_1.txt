Gung ho () is an English term, with the current meaning of 'overly enthusiastic or energetic'. It originated during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945) from a  Chinese term, 工合 (pinyin: gōnghé; lit. 'to work together'), short for Chinese Industrial Cooperatives (Chinese: 工業合作社; pinyin: Gōngyè Hézuòshè).
