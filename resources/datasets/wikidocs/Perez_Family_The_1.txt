The Perez Family is an American comedy film released in 1995 about a group of Cuban refugees in America who pretend to be a family.  It stars Marisa Tomei, Alfred Molina, Anjelica Huston, Chazz Palminteri, and other well-known actors.  It was based on the 1990 novel The Perez Family by Christine Bell.  The film was directed by Mira Nair.
The premise was that a group of unrelated people, who happened to share the last name "Pérez", realized they could more easily stay in America if they pretended to be family.  Set in 1980 during the Mariel boatlift, the movie shows Juan Raúl Pérez (Alfred Molina), a former aristocrat and newly released political prisoner, seeking to return to his wife, now in America, after 20 years.  Dottie Pérez (Marisa Tomei) is a former prostitute, who Juan meets.  U.S. Immigration officials assume the two are married, because of the common last name.  The potential for a real romantic relationship between the couple sets the basis for much of the rest of the film.
