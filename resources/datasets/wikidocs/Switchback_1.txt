The Dark Pictures Anthology is an anthology series of interactive drama and survival horror video games developed by Supermassive Games and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment. The anthology is planned to consist of eight games, with each game inspired by a different horror genre. Each game features five main characters whose survival depends on the choices made by the player. While each character only appears in one game, face models are often reused in other games, except those of the leading actors. The games use a third-person perspective and the ability to choose from various dialogue options and courses of action.
The series began its first season with Man of Medan (2019), which is followed by Little Hope (2020), House of Ashes (2021), and The Devil in Me (2022). The upcoming Directive 8020 will kick off the anthology's second season. A spin-off video game, The Dark Pictures: Switchback VR, was released by Supermassive Games for the PlayStation VR2 on 16 March 2023.
