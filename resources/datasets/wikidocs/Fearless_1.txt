Fearless (Taylor's Version) is the first re-recorded album by the American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, released on April 9, 2021, by Republic Records. It is part of Swift's re-recording projects following the 2019 dispute over the ownership of her back catalog released by Big Machine Records. Fearless (Taylor's Version) comprises re-recordings of the tracks on Swift's second studio album, Fearless (2008), the soundtrack single "Today Was a Fairytale" for the 2010 film Valentine's Day, and six previously unreleased "From the Vault" tracks.
Fearless (Taylor's Version) is a country pop album composed of acoustic instruments such as guitars, banjo, fiddle, and strings. The lyrics are about Swift's adolescent reflections and feelings on love and heartbreak. Swift and Christopher Rowe produced the re-recorded tracks, and they feature identical arrangements as with the original but their instruments and vocals are more defined and controlled. Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner worked with Swift to produce the vault tracks, which have an indie- and-electronic-oriented soundscape brought by synthesizers and drum programming. Two vault tracks feature guest vocals from Maren Morris and Keith Urban respectively.
The album was preceded by "Love Story (Taylor's Version)", the re-recording of Fearless's lead single "Love Story", and the vault tracks "You All Over Me" and "Mr. Perfectly Fine". Fearless (Taylor's Version) topped the charts in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Critics praised the re-recorded album for what they deemed an enhanced production quality that brought a nostalgic feel, but some considered vault tracks are insubstantial. Many attributed Swift's enduring popularity to the lyrical sentiments that appealed to a broad audience, and the media highlighted Fearless (Taylor's Version) as a significant event contributing to a wider industry discourse over artists' rights.
