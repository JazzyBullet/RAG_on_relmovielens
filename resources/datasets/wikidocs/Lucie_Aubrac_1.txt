Lucie Samuel (29 June 1912 – 14 March 2007), born Bernard and known as Lucie Aubrac (French pronunciation: [lysi obʁak] ), was a member of the French Resistance in World War II. A history teacher by occupation, she earned a history agrégation in 1938, a highly uncommon achievement for a woman at that time. In 1939 she married Raymond Samuel, who took the name Aubrac in the Resistance. She was active on a number of operations, including prison breakouts. Like her husband, she was a communist militant, which she remained after the war. She sat in the Provisional Consultative Assembly in Paris from 1944 to 1945.
Her life was depicted in the 1997 film Lucie Aubrac by Claude Berri. The Paris Métro station Bagneux–Lucie Aubrac was named after her.
