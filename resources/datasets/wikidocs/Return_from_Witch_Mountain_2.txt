== Origin ==


=== Novels ===
The Walt Disney Company's Witch Mountain franchise is based on the 1968 science fiction novel Escape to Witch Mountain, written by Alexander Key. The events of the story follow two teenage orphans named Tony and Tia, who have paranormal abilities. The pair, who have little recollection of their past, are placed into a juvenile detention home by social services. After being released to a man self-described to be their "uncle", they discover his nefarious plans in using them for personal gain. Over the events of the book, the two remember their true nature as extraterrestrial life who came to Earth, when their home-planet was being destroyed. The duo escape with the remainder of their people, who call themselves "Castaways".
A sequel novel titled Return from Witch Mountain was released in 1978 by the Walt Disney Studios, to coincide with the release of their feature film of the same title. Key penned the novelization, based on the screenplay by Malcolm Marmorstein. It had originally been published in 1978 by the Westminster Press in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.


=== Development ===
The Walt Disney Company released a 1975 feature film adaptation that was mostly faithful to the source material. The film was one of the studio's most successful live-action films at the time. Following the positive response to the film, the franchise continued with later installments.
