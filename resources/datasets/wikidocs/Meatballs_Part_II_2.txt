Meatballs III: Summer Job is a 1987 Canadian comedy film and the third installment in the Meatballs film series. It is the first of the series to be rated R. Whereas Meatballs Part II was unconnected to the first movie, this film follows an adult Rudy Gerner, one of the main characters from Meatballs, now working a summer job for an angry boss named Mean Gene. Unlike the first two movies, this one is not set at summer camp, but rather at a nearby marina.
