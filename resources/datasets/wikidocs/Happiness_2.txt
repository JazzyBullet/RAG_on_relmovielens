The World Happiness Report is a publication that contains articles and rankings of national happiness, based on respondent ratings of their own lives, which the report also correlates with various (quality of) life factors. The report primarily uses data from the Gallup World Poll. As of March 2024, Finland has been ranked the happiest country in the world seven times in a row.
Since 2024, the report has been published under a partnership between Gallup, the Wellbeing Research Centre at the University of Oxford, and the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network. The editorial team includes three founding editors, John F. Helliwell, Richard Layard, and Jeffrey D. Sachs, and editors, Jan-Emmanuel De Neve, Lara Aknin, and Shun Wang.
