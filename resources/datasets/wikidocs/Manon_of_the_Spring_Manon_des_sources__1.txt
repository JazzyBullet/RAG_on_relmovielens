Manon des sources (French pronunciation: [manɔ̃ de suʁs]; meaning Manon of the Spring) is a 1986 French language period film directed by Claude Berri, as the second part of a diptych with Jean de Florette, released the same year.
Both are the adaptation of Marcel Pagnol’s 1963 two-volume novel The Water of the Hills, itself an adaptation of his own 1952 film Manon of the Spring, which became the novel’s second part.
The two films are ranked No. 60 in Empire magazine's "The 100 Best Films of World Cinema" in 2010.
