This is a list of Academy Awardâ€“winning films.
If a film won the Academy Award for Best Picture, its entry is listed in a shaded background with a boldface title.
Competitive Oscars are separated from non-competitive Oscars (i.e. Honorary Award, Special Achievement Award, Juvenile Award); as such, any films that were awarded a non-competitive award will be shown in brackets next to the number of competitive wins.
