== Plot ==
Twenty-five-year-old Mookie lives in Bedfordâ€“Stuyvesant with his sister Jade, has a toddler son named Hector with his Latina girlfriend Tina, and works as a delivery man at a pizzeria owned by Salvatore "Sal" Frangione, an Italian-American who lives in Bensonhurst. Sal's racist eldest son Pino is antagonistic towards Mookie, clashing with his father, who refuses to move his business out of the majority African-American neighborhood, and his younger brother Vito, who is friendly with Mookie.
Many distinctive residents are introduced, including friendly drunk Da Mayor; Mother Sister, who observes the block from her brownstone; Radio Raheem, who blasts Public Enemy's "Fight the Power" on his boombox wherever he goes; and Smiley, a mentally disabled man who meanders around town trying to sell hand-colored pictures of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr.
At Sal's, Mookie's friend Buggin' Out questions Sal about his "Wall of Fame", decorated with photos of famous Italian-Americans, and demands that Sal put up pictures of Black celebrities since the pizzeria is in a Black neighborhood. When Sal declines and ejects him, Buggin' Out attempts to start boycotting the pizzeria.

Buggin' Out badmouths Sal and his sons and threatens to shutter the pizzeria, upsetting Sal, who destroys Raheem's boombox with a bat. Raheem then attacks Sal. His sons and the others struggle to get him off of Sal, then the fight spills out into the street and attracts a crowd. While Raheem is strangling Sal, the police arrive, including Officers Long and Ponte, who break up the fight and apprehend Raheem and Buggin' Out. As the officers attempt to restrain Raheem, Long begins choking him with his nightstick. Though Ponte and onlookers plead for him to stop, Long tightens his choke-hold on Raheem, killing him. Attempting to save face, the duo place his body in the back of a police car and drive off.
The onlookers blame Sal and his sons, but Da Mayor unsuccessfully tries to convince the crowd of Sal's innocence. In a
