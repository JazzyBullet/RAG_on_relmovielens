Monsieur Verdoux is a 1947 American black comedy film directed by and starring Charlie Chaplin, who plays a bigamist wife killer inspired by serial killer Henri Désiré Landru. The supporting cast includes Martha Raye, William Frawley, and Marilyn Nash.
In the film, a bank teller is fired after three decades of work. The unemployed man still has to financially support his incapacitated wife and their child. He resorts to entering bigamous marriages with wealthy widows, killing each of them in turn. Years later, the con man goes bankrupt and loses his family. During a dinner with an old acquaintance, he is recognized by the family of one of his victims. He is sentenced to death in a murder trial, but compares his relatively few victims to the millions of people killed in wars waged for profit. The film ends with the killer heading to his execution.
