The Exorcist is an American horror media franchise that originated with William Peter Blatty's 1971 horror novel of the same name (itself inspired by the 1949 exorcism of Roland Doe) and most prominently featured in a 1973 film adaptation of the novel, and many subsequent prequels and sequels. All of these installments focus on fictional accounts of people possessed by Pazuzu, the main antagonist of the series, and the efforts of religious authorities to counter this possession.
The films have grossed over $661 million at the worldwide box office and the novel has sold over 13 million copies. 20th Century Fox Television developed a 2016 television series as a continuation of the 1973 film, to generally positive reviews. As of 2020, a reboot of the film series, which was later changed to a direct sequel to the 1973 film was in development with David Gordon Green as director. Produced by Blumhouse Productions, the film was released by Universal Pictures on October 6, 2023. Following the failure of the film, plans for a trilogy were scrapped in favor of a reboot with Mike Flanagan as director.

=== The Exorcist (1971) ===

The Exorcist is a 1971 novel by American writer William Peter Blatty. It was adapted into the 1973 film of the same name. The book details the demonic possession of twelve-year-old Regan MacNeil, the daughter of a famous actress, and the two priests who attempt to exorcise the demon. It was published by Harper & Row.
The novel was inspired by a 1949 case of demonic possession and exorcism that Blatty heard about while he was a student in the class of 1950 at Georgetown University. As a result, the novel takes place in Washington D.C. near the campus of Georgetown University. In September 2011, the novel was reprinted by HarperCollins to celebrate its 40th anniversary, with slight revisions made by Blatty as well as interior title artwork by Jeremy Caniglia.


=== Legion (1983) ===

Legion is the 1983 follow-up to the Exorcist novel, also written by William Peter Blatty. It was made into the movie The Exorcist III in 1990. Like The Exorcist, it involves demonic possession. The book was the focus of a court case over its exclusion from The New York Times Best Seller list.
Blatty based aspects of the Gemini Killer on the real-life Zodiac Killer, who, in a January 1974 letter to the San Francisco Chronicle, had praised the original Exorcist film as "the best satirical comedy that I have ever seen".
