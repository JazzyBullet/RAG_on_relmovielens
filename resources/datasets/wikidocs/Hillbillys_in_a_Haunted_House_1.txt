A pair of country singers and their band are headed to Nashville, Tennessee. Their car unfortunately breaks down and they stop overnight at an abandoned house, which turns out to be haunted. A ring of international spies (Lon Chaney Jr., Basil Rathbone and John Carradine) who live in the haunted house are seeking a top-secret formula for rocket fuel. While it is never revealed for whom they are spying, they carry out their activities under the cover of a supposed haunted house, which comes complete with a gorilla lurking in the basement.
