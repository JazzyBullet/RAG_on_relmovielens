The Devil's Own is a 1997 American thriller film directed by Alan J. Pakula, starring Harrison Ford and Brad Pitt, with Rub√©n Blades, Natascha McElhone, Julia Stiles, Margaret Colin, and Treat Williams in supporting roles. The plot revolves around a member of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (Pitt) who comes to the United States to obtain black market anti-aircraft missiles, but his plan is complicated by an Irish-American policeman (Ford), whom the IRA member has come to regard as family.
The film was released by Columbia Pictures on March 26, 1997. It received mixed reviews from critics, but was a financial success. This was the final film of director Pakula, who died the year after its release, and the final film photographed by Gordon Willis, who retired soon after.
