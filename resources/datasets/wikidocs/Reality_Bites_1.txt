Reality Bites is a 1994 American romantic comedy-drama film written by Helen Childress and directed by Ben Stiller in his feature directorial debut. It stars Winona Ryder, Ethan Hawke, and Stiller, with supporting roles by Janeane Garofalo and Steve Zahn. In the film, Lelaina (Ryder), an aspiring videographer, works on a documentary about the disenchanted lives of her friends and roommates.
Childress wrote the initial screenplay on spec in 1990, inspired by the lives of her and her friends during the recession. Stiller was initially hired solely as director in 1991, and starred in the film after working with Childress for nine to ten months on the final screenplay, which was completed in December 1992. The film faced production delays until Ryder committed to the project, which led to the casting of Hawke and Zahn. Garofalo was fired during filming but was recast after Ryder stepped in on her behalf. Principal photography lasted 42 days in 1993, with filming taking place in Houston and Los Angeles.
Reality Bites received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for the performances of Ryder, Hawke and Garofalo. It grossed $41 million worldwide. It also appeared on some critics' year-end lists for 1994 and 1995.
While actress Janeane Garofalo has rejected the film's reputation as a Generation X movie, many have embraced it as such. The film has since achieved cult status for its depiction of the career and lifestyle choices faced by young adults.
