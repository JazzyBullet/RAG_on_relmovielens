The Distinguished Gentleman's Ride is a global motorcycle event raising funds and awareness for prostate cancer research and men's mental health programs on behalf of the Movember Foundation.
Open to all genders, The Distinguished Gentleman's Ride was founded in 2012 by Mark Hawwa in Sydney, Australia, and is centred around classic and vintage styled motorcycles. While the event encompasses classic and vintage style, it also welcomes niche custom motorcycle styles such as cafe racers, choppers, scramblers, and more.
To date the event has raised $31.6 million USD, from 340,000 classic and vintage riders, located in 115 countries.
The ride provides an outline of dress and behaviour, suggesting riders wear dapper clothing, silk vests, tweed suits and behave courteously, donning not only classic style, but classic manners. Suggested motorcycles for the themed ride include caf√© racers, bobbers, classics, modern classics, flat trackers, scramblers, old school choppers, brat styled, classic scooters, and classic sidecars. The ride carries no entry fee; however, some rides require minimum donation amounts to join. All riders are encouraged to raise funds for prostate cancer research and men's mental health programs on behalf of charity partner the Movember Foundation.
In 2014 Triumph Motorcycles started to support and sponsor the ride,. For 2019, joining global sponsors Triumph Motorcycles are luxury helmet brand, Hedon Helmets, as well as REV'IT!, and Elf Lubricants, joining the event as global prize sponsor.
