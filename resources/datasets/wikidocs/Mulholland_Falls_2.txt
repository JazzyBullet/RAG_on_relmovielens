== Early life ==
Jennifer Lynn Connelly was born on December 12, 1970, in Cairo, New York, in the Catskill Mountains, the only child of Ilene Carol (née Schumann; 1942–2013), an antique dealer, and Gerard Karl Connelly, a clothing manufacturer. She has an older sister from her father's previous marriage. Her father was a Catholic of Irish and Norwegian descent. Her mother was Jewish and was educated at a yeshiva; Connelly's maternal ancestors were Jewish emigrants from Poland and Russia. Connelly was raised primarily in Brooklyn Heights, near the Brooklyn Bridge, where she attended Saint Ann's, a private school specializing in the arts. Her father suffered from asthma so the family moved to Woodstock, New York, in 1976, to escape the city smog. Four years later, the family returned to Brooklyn Heights, and Connelly returned to Saint Ann's School.
After graduating from high school in 1988, Connelly went to Yale University to study English literature. She has described herself as a conscientious student who "wasn't really concerned with having a social life or sleeping or eating much. I was really nerdy and pretty much stayed in the law school library, which is open 24 hours, most of the time I wasn't in class." After two years at Yale, Connelly transferred to Stanford University to study drama. There, she trained with Roy London, Howard Fine, and Harold Guskin. Encouraged by her parents to continue with her film career, Connelly left college and returned to the film industry the same year.
