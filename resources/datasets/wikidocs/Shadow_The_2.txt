Shadow the Hedgehog is a character who appears in Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. He was created by Takashi Iizuka and Shiro Maekawa and first appeared in Sonic Adventure 2 (2001). Within Sonic's fictional universe, Shadow is an anthropomorphic black hedgehog created by Professor Gerald Robotnik, the grandfather of the series' antagonist Doctor Eggman. After witnessing the death of his best friend Maria Robotnik, Shadow initially seeks revenge, but later vows to keep his promise to her that he would protect the world from danger. An antihero, Shadow has good intentions but will do whatever it takes to accomplish his goals, putting him at odds with Sonic the Hedgehog.
Shadow shares many attributes with Sonic and controls similarly in games, but is distinguished by his use of vehicles and firearms. The idea for Shadow originated during the development of Sonic Adventure (1998). Iizuka and Maekawa sought to portray him as a subtle, "cool" character players could care about. Sonic Adventure 2 was intended to be Shadow's only appearance, but his popularity among fans led to Sonic Team including him in Sonic Heroes (2003). Shadow has since featured in numerous Sonic games, including the spin-off Shadow the Hedgehog (2005). He also appears in Sonic adaptations, comics, and merchandise.
Shadow is one of the series' most popular characters and was named one of the greatest video game characters by Guinness World Records in 2011. However, he has proven divisive among video game journalists. Some have praised his role in Sonic Adventure 2 and his levels' preservation of the Sonic theme, but others have criticized his dark and brooding characterization, particularly in later games. Writers have ranked Shadow among the worst Sonic characters. The Shadow game received generally unfavorable reviews, though it sold well.
