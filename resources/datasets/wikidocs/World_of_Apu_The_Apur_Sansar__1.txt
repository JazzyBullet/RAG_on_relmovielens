Apur Sansar (Bengali: অপুর সংসার), also known as The World of Apu, is a 1959 Indian Bengali-language drama film produced, written and directed by Satyajit Ray. It is based on the second half of Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay's novel Aparajito. Following Pather Panchali (1955) and Aparajito (1956), The World of Apu is the final part of Ray's The Apu Trilogy, about the childhood and early adulthood of a young Bengali named Apu in early twentieth century India. The World of Apu stars Soumitra Chatterjee (as Apu) and Sharmila Tagore (as Apu's wife Aparna); the duo would go on to appear in many subsequent Ray films.
Upon its release on 1 May 1959, The World of Apu was well-received by critics. It won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film as well as several international awards, including the Sutherland Award for Best Original And Imaginative Film and National Board of Review Award for Best Foreign Language Film.
