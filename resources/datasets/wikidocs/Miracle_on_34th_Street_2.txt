Miracle on 34th Street is a 1994 American Christmas fantasy comedy-drama film directed by Les Mayfield and produced and co-written by John Hughes. The film stars Richard Attenborough, Elizabeth Perkins, Dylan McDermott, J. T. Walsh, James Remar, Mara Wilson, and Robert Prosky. It is the first theatrical remake of the original 1947 film. Like the original, this film was released by 20th Century Fox.
The New York City based Macy's department store declined any involvement with this remake, saying "we feel the original stands on its own and could not be improved upon"; the fictitious "Cole's" became its replacement. Gimbels had ceased operations in 1987; hence it was replaced by the fictional "Shopper's Express".
