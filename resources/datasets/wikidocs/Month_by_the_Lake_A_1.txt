== Critical reception ==
In a contemporary review Roger Ebert called the film; "a sly romantic comedy about a collision of sex, ego, will and pride, all peeping out from beneath great thick layers of British reticence. Its delights are wrapped in a lavish production in a beautiful time and place."


== Awards ==
In 1996, Redgrave was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, losing to Nicole Kidman for To Die For. This marks John Irvin's first Golden Globe nominated film.
