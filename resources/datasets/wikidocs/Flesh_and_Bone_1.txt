In December 1999, Flesh-n-Bone was involved in a dispute with one-time friend Tarrance Vickers. During the dispute, Flesh-n-Bone pulled out a loaded semiautomatic AK-47 rifle and took aim at Vickers. The presiding Van Nuys Superior Court Judge deemed Howse's life story "one of the worst cases of child abuse she had ever read, full of beatings and other physical, emotional, and mental traumas." Flesh-n-Bone apologized and took responsibility for his actions and pleaded guilty. On September 22, 2000, Howse was sent to Pleasant Valley State Prison for 12 years on charges of assault with a deadly weapon and violation of probation. He was also required to undertake an anger-management course.
Flesh-n-Bone was picked up on gun possession charges on Thursday, April 2, 2009, in Santa Clarita, CA, according to TMZ. He was held without bail. However, the gun possession charges against him were dropped on April 20, 2009 in a Santa Clarita courthouse. "The defense turned over some information, and we investigated and realized we were unable to proceed with the charges as filed, so the judge dismissed the case," said Jane Robinson, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles district attorneys office.
On March 28, 2010, during the Bone Thugs-n-Harmony reunion tour, Flesh-n-Bone was picked up on a 10-year-old felony warrant in Cleveland, Ohio during a show at the House Of Blues. He was released from custody five days later and charges were dismissed.
