Big Bully is a 1996 American black comedy film directed by Steve Miner, written by Mark Steven Johnson and starring Rick Moranis and Tom Arnold as two men, a childhood bully and his victim, as they reconnect as adults.
It was panned by critics and was a box office bomb, earning only $2 million from a $15 million budget. It was Rick Moranis' last on-screen role in a theatrical release, prior to his long hiatus from acting.
Although the film is set in Minnesota, it was actually filmed in Vancouver and Ladysmith, British Columbia, Canada. The school scenes were filmed at the Kitsilano Secondary School in Vancouver.
