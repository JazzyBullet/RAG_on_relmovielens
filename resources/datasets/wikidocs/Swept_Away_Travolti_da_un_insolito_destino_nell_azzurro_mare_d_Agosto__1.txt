Swept Away... by an Unusual Destiny in the Blue Sea of August (Italian: Travolti da un insolito destino nell'azzurro mare d'agosto), usually shortened to Swept Away, is a 1974 Italian romantic adventure comedy drama written and directed by Lina Wertm√ºller, starring Giancarlo Giannini and Mariangela Melato. The film follows a wealthy woman whose yachting vacation with friends in the Mediterranean Sea takes an unexpected turn when she and one of the boat's crew are separated from the others and they become stranded on a desert island. The woman's capitalist beliefs and the man's communist convictions clash, but during their struggle to survive their situation, their social roles are reversed.
Swept Away was released to divided, but largely positive, reviews, and it won the 1975 National Board of Review of Motion Pictures Award for Top Foreign Film. An English-language remake starring Madonna and directed by her then-husband Guy Ritchie was released in 2002.
