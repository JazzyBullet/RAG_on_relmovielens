White Man's Burden is a 1995 American drama film about racism, set in an alternative America where the social and economic positions of black people and white people are reversed. The film was written and directed by Desmond Nakano. The film revolves around Louis Pinnock (John Travolta), a white factory worker, who kidnaps Thaddeus Thomas (Harry Belafonte), a black factory owner, for firing Pinnock over a perceived slight.
The title is a well-known phrase inspired by the famous poem of the same title by Rudyard Kipling.
