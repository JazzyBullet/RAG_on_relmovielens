Any Given Sunday is the soundtrack to the 1999 film of the same name. It was released on January 4, 2000, through Atlantic Records and consisted of a blend of hip hop, heavy metal, alternative rock, and R&B. The album found success on the Billboard charts, making it to No. 28 on the Billboard 200 and No. 11 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, and featured the single "Shut 'Em Down", which peaked at No. 31 on the Hot Rap Singles.
Any Given Sunday, Vol. 2 picks up where the original soundtrack left off. Once again, actor Jamie Foxx closes the album out with the theme song, but cuts from Moby, Zapp & Roger, and Ozomatli are also featured. Ex-Band guitarist Robbie Robertson leads with five tracks, including "Bended Knee", "Ghost Dance", "Amazing Grace", and "Out of the Blue".
