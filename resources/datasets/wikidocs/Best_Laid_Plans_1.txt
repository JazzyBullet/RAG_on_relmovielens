The Best Laid Plans is a 1997 thriller novel by Sidney Sheldon. The story details the rise of a handsome, charismatic attorney named Oliver Russel, to political fame, while his jilted fianc√©e, Leslie Stewart, grows a media empire to eventually destroy his career and image. Possible inspiration for the title comes from a paraphrasing of the Robert Burns poem "To a Mouse" into modern English.
