Ghost in the Shell: The New Movie (Japanese: 攻殻機動隊 新劇場版, Hepburn: Kōkaku Kidōtai: Shin Gekijōban, lit. Mobile Armored Riot Police: The New Theatrical Edition), also known in Japan as Ghost in the Shell: The Movie or New Ghost in the Shell, is a 2015 Japanese animated science fiction film directed by Kazuya Nomura. A continuation of the Ghost in the Shell: Arise story arc, The New Movie is the first feature in the series since Ghost in the Shell SAC: Solid State Society in 2006. The film is a continuation of Pyrophoric Cult (the final episode of Arise), and ties up loose ends from that arc.
