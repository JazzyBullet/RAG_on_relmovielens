The Chevrolet Suburban is a series of SUVs built by Chevrolet since the 1935 model year.  The longest-used automobile nameplate in the world, the Chevrolet Suburban is currently in its twelfth generation, introduced for 2021.  Beginning life as one of the first metal-bodied station wagons, the Suburban is the progenitor of the modern full-size SUV, combining a wagon-style body with the chassis and powertrain of a pickup truck.  Alongside its Advance Design, Task Force, and C/K predecessors, the Chevrolet Silverado currently shares chassis and mechanical commonality with the Suburban and other trucks.     
Traditionally one of the most profitable vehicles sold by General Motors, the Suburban has been marketed through both Chevrolet and GMC for nearly its entire production.  Along sharing the Suburban name with Chevrolet, GMC has used several nameplates for the model line; since 2000, the division has marketed it as the GMC Yukon XL.  Since 2003, Cadillac has marketed the Suburban as the Cadillac Escalade ESV.  During the 1990s, GM Australia marketed right-hand drive Suburbans under the Holden brand.    
.The Suburban is sold in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Central America, Chile, Dominican Republic, Bolivia, Peru, Philippines, and the Middle East (except Israel), while the Yukon XL is sold only in North America (exclusive to the United States, Canada, and Mexico) and the Middle East territories (except Israel).
A 2018 iSeeCars.com study identified the Chevrolet Suburban as the car that is driven the most each year. A 2019 iSeeCars.com study named the Chevrolet Suburban the second-ranked longest-lasting vehicle. In December 2019, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce unveiled a Hollywood Walk of Fame star for the Suburban, noting that the Suburban had been in "1,750 films and TV shows since 1952."
