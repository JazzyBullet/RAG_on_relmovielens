The contestants on the show are 10 glassblowers. Katherine Gray, an artist and associate professor at California State University, San Bernardino, is the chief judge. Nick Uhas, a former Big Brother USA contestant and science YouTuber, hosted the show for its first three seasons. Hunter March became the host for season 4. The winner receives a prize package worth the equivalent of $60,000, including an artist residency at the Corning Museum of Glass. The first season was filmed in a converted warehouse in Hamilton, Ontario, a facility that was "custom-built to accommodate 10 glass blowers working simultaneously". Industry experts from the Craft and Design Glass Studio at Sheridan College, Pilchuck Glass School, and the Corning Museum of Glass consulted the producers during the construction of the facility and provided advice and evaluation to the contestants each round.
