Prom Night III: The Last Kiss is a 1989 Canadian black comedy slasher film and the third in the Prom Night film series, continuing the storyline involving the murderous female ghost named Mary Lou Maloney. This is the only entry to depart from the horror genre, and is instead a spoof of the previous films.
Prom Night III was released theatrically in Canada on April 13, 1990, and direct-to-video in the United States on June 1, 1989. The film was followed by another sequel, Prom Night IV: Deliver Us from Evil (1992).
