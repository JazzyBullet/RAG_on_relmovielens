Under the Rainbow is a 1981 American comedy film directed by Steve Rash and starring Chevy Chase, Carrie Fisher, Eve Arden, and Billy Barty. Set in 1938, the film's plot is loosely based on the gathering of little people in a Hollywood hotel to audition for roles as Munchkins in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. Jerry Maren, who had a role as a Munchkin in the original film, also appears in Under the Rainbow. Filming locations include the original Culver Hotel, which was used by the Munchkins during the filming of The Wizard of Oz.
The film received widespread negative reception with critics due to its depiction of little people and use of sight gags involving them. Earning just $8.3 million during its initial run, the film is considered a box office flop. It was nominated for two Golden Raspberry Awards for Joe Renzetti and Billy Barty.
