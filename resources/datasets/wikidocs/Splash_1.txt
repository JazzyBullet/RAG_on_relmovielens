Splash Splash Love (Korean: 퐁당퐁당 LOVE; RR: Pongdang Pongdang LOVE) is a South Korean television series starring Kim Seul-gi and Yoon Doo-joon. It initially aired on web platform Naver TV Cast in a 10-episode format. It was then broadcast by MBC on December 13 and 20, 2015 in two 60-minute episodes.
The series aired two years after the popular novel Moonlight Drawn by Clouds was serialized on Naver in 2013. Like Splash, Moonlight is about the love story between a cross-dressing eunuch and a monarch. The novel is the original work from which the drama Love in the Moonlight (2016) was adapted from.
