This list of The Karate Kid and Cobra Kai characters reflects fictional characters from The Karate Kid franchise. Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz, and Hayden Schlossberg define the following works as part of the "Miyagi-verse" (characters who interacted with Mr. Miyagi) canon: The Karate Kid (1984), The Karate Kid Part II (1986), The Karate Kid Part III (1989), The Next Karate Kid (1994), and the Cobra Kai television series (2018â€“present). Hurwitz clarified that the Karate Kid television series is not canon, but an easter egg from it appears in Season 3 of Cobra Kai.
