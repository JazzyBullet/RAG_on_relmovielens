Joe (Joseph) Chester is an Irish composer and musician. His albums have won acclaim, from his debut solo record, A Murder of Crows, The Easter Vigil (which was named the "Best Irish Album" of 2017), and Jupiter's Wife, which was his sixth (the Best Irish album of 2020 according to the Irish Daily Mirror).
In recent years, he has turned his attention to composing contemporary music for classical guitar. His first major commission, LUCIA, commissioned by Axis Ballymun for the centenary of James Joyce's Ulysses, was inspired by fragments of the life of Lucia Joyce, James Joyce's daughter. According to The Irish Times, it was "deft and well-considered, the work spins and soars. An elegant, discordant gem." The Times called it "a stunning tribute."
He has been lead guitarist with many groups, including The Waterboys and Gemma Hayes, and is the producer and guitarist of Dublin band A Lazarus Soul.
