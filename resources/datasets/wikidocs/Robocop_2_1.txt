RoboCop 2 is a 1990 American science fiction action film directed by Irvin Kershner and written by Frank Miller and Walon Green. It stars Peter Weller, Nancy Allen, Dan O'Herlihy, Belinda Bauer, Tom Noonan and Gabriel Damon. It is the sequel to the 1987 film RoboCop, the second entry in the RoboCop franchise and the last to feature Weller as RoboCop until he returned in Mortal Kombat 11, RoboCop: Rogue City and other media; it is also the last film Kershner directed before his death in 2010.
Set in a dystopian Detroit, the plot follows RoboCop (Weller) as he becomes embroiled in a scheme made by Omni Consumer Products to bankrupt and take over the city while also fighting the spread of a street drug called "Nuke" and its gang of dealers led by Cain (Noonan). The film was shot on-location in Houston.
The film received mixed reviews upon its release and earned a moderate box office return, grossing $45 million worldwide, compared to the previous film's $53 million gross on a significantly smaller production budget. It was nominated for three Saturn Awards, including Best Science Fiction Film, Best Performance by a Younger Actor (for Damon), and Best Special Effects (for Phil Tippett, Rob Bottin and Peter Kuran). A sequel, RoboCop 3, was released in 1993. Miller would return to write the comic book sequel RoboCop Versus The Terminator in 1992 and Steven Grant adapted his original screenplays for the second and third films into the comics Frank Miller's RoboCop from 2003 to 2006 and 2013 to 2014.
