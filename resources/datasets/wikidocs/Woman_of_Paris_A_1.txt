A Woman of Paris is a feature-length American silent film starring Edna Purviance that debuted in 1923. A United Artists production, the film was an atypical drama film for its creator, written, directed, produced and later scored by Charlie Chaplin. It is also known as A Woman of Paris: A Drama of Fate.
A Woman of Paris was Chaplin’s first and last effort in “straight dramatic subject matter”: his next film was the highly acclaimed comedy The Gold Rush (1925).
