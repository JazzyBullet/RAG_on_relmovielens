Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein is a 1948 American horror comedy film directed by Charles Barton. The film features Count Dracula (Bela Lugosi) who has become partners with Dr Sandra Mornay (Lenore Aubert), in order to find a brain to reactivate Frankenstein's monster (Glenn Strange); the ideal brain they find belonging to Wilbur Grey (Lou Costello).
The film was developed and production started with misgivings from Abbott and Costello, with Costello specifically not liking the script. The film was made with difficulty according to director Barton, who found Abbott and Costello often absent from the set. On the film's release, it was one of Universal-Internationals' biggest films of the year and led to several follow-ups involving Abbott and Costello meeting other horror film actors and monsters. The film was mostly well received by critics on its release and in 2001, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry; it also placed at number 56 on the list of the American Film Institute's "100 Funniest American Movies".
