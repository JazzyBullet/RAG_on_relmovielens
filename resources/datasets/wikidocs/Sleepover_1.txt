A sleepover (also known as a slumber party or pajama party) is a social occasion where a young person stays at the home of a friend. Multiple people and/or friends may sleepover at the friend's home. Typically a younger person will partake in a sleepover; however, an adult or older person may sleep at a friend's home.
