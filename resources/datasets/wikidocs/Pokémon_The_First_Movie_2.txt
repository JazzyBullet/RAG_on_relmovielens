Pokémon: The First Movie: Music From and Inspired By the Motion Picture is the soundtrack to the first Pokémon film in the North American markets. Some of the songs were featured in the animated short Pikachu's Vacation, and some songs did not feature in either the short or the movie at all. The CD contains extra features, such as Pokémon videos and a screensaver. When it was released, it included a promotion to send in a proof of purchase for an exclusive Jigglypuff card from the Pokémon TCG.
Alongside this soundtrack, the orchestral score from the movie was also released on the CD Pokémon: The First Movie Original Motion Picture Score.
The soundtrack was released on Atlantic Records, a sister company to Warner Bros., the film's distributor outside Japan.
