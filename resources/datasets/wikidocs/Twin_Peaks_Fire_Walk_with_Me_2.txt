The following is an incomplete list of characters from the television series Twin Peaks, the film Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me, and the 2017 revival.

== Supernatural/Otherworldly ==


=== Bob ===

Frank Silva was a set decorator who worked on the pilot episode. One day, when he was moving furniture in Laura Palmer's bedroom, a woman warned Silva not to get locked in the room. The image of Silva trapped in the room sparked something in Lynch, who then asked Silva if he was an actor. Silva said yes, and Lynch told him that he had a role in mind for him on the series. Silva accepted, and Lynch shot footage of him behind Laura's bed with no real idea of what he would do with it.
Silva's reflection was accidentally caught in the footage of Sarah Palmer's frightening vision at the end of the pilot. Sarah sees a hand uncovering Laura's heart necklace from the ground, and Silva can be seen in the mirror behind her head. Lynch was made aware of this accident and decided to keep Silva in the scene.


=== Mike ===

Mike made his appearance in the pilot episode which was only originally intended to be a "kind of homage to The Fugitive. The only thing he was gonna do was be in this elevator and walk out." However, when Lynch wrote the "fire walk with me" speech, he imagined Mike saying it in the basement of the Twin Peaks hospital – a scene that would appear in an alternative version of the pilot episode, and surface later in Agent Cooper's dream sequence. Mike's alias, Phillip Michael Gerard, is also a reference to Lieutenant Phillip Gerard, a character in The Fugitive.


=== The Man from Another Place ===

Lynch met Michael J. Anderson in 1987. After seeing him in a short film, Lynch wanted to cast the actor in the title role in Ronnie Rocket, but the project ultimately fell through.
While editing the alternate ending of the foreign version of the pilot episode, an idea occurred to Lynch on his way home one day: "I was leaning against a car — the front of me was leaning against this very warm car. My hands were on the roof and the metal was very hot. The Red Room scene leapt into my mind. 'Little Mike' was there, and he was speaking backwards... For the rest of the night I thought only about The Red Room."


== FBI / DEA ==


=== Special Agent Dale Cooper ===

Special Agent Dale Cooper, played by Kyle MacLachlan, is the protagonist of the series. Cooper is an FBI agent who arrives in Twin Peaks in 1989 to investigate the brutal murder of popular high-school student Laura Palmer. He falls in love with the town and gains a great deal of acceptance within the tightly knit community. Cooper displays an array of quirky, whimsical mannerisms, such as giving a "thumbs up" when satisfied, sage-like sayings (often inspired by his fascination with Tibet), and a distinctive sense of humor, along with his love for cherry pie and "a damn fine cup of coffee." One of his most popular habits is recording messages containing everyday observations and abstract thoughts on his current case to his secretary, Diane, into a microcassette recorder he carries. His investigative techniques go far beyond the FBI's usual ones, including intuitive exercises and analysis of his dreams. He becomes deeply involved with the inhabitants of Twin Peaks and remains in town after the resolution of the Laura Palmer case, especially once his nemesis and former partner Windom Earle starts menacing the town in order to exploit its supernatural properties.


=== Albert Rosenfield ===
Albert Rosenfield, played by Miguel Ferrer, is a talented forensic analyst Dale Cooper calls in to assist on the Laura Palmer case. He is also an original member of the Blue Rose Task Force and by 2014, is the only member who has not disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Rosenfield's abrasive and mocking personality alienates the Twin Peaks sheriff's department relatively quickly; he compares Andy to a dog and repeatedly insults Sheriff Harry
