Vive l'amour (simplified Chinese: 爱情万岁; traditional Chinese: 愛情萬歲; pinyin: Àiqíng wànsuì; lit. 'long live love') is a 1994 Taiwanese New Wave film directed by Tsai Ming-liang. Starring Lee Kang-sheng, Yang Kuei-mei and Chen Chao-jung.
The film had its world premiere at the 51st Venice International Film Festival, where it won the Golden Lion, the festival's top prize.
While the film was celebrated by most film critics when it was first released, its vague story-line and cinematic techniques resulted in an average box office turnout.
