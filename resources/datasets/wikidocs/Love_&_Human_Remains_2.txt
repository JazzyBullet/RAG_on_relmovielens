Using and subverting elements of various genres, including thriller, situation comedy and grade-B horror film, the piece is written with cynical humor, but is serious in tone. A group of friends, both old & new, live their lives in a Canadian Metropolis. David & Candy are two roommates looking for love, perhaps in the wrong places. Bernie is David's best friend. Kane is David's coworker. Jeri is a lesbian that Candy meets. Rick is a bartender, with a secret, who takes an interest in Candy. Benita is a psychic whose talents feature heavily in the last moments of the play. As the action happens around the group of friends, a serial killer is making victims of various women in the city.
