In sociology, the ruling class of a society is the social class who set and decide the political and economic agenda of society. 
In Marxist philosophy, the ruling class are the class who own the means of production in a given society and apply their cultural hegemony to determine and establish the dominant ideology (ideas, culture, mores, norms, traditions) of the society. They are also called the bourgeoisie. 
In the 21st century, the worldwide political economy established by globalization has created a transnational capitalist class who are not native to any one country.
