Circus (stylized CiRcuS) is the second studio album released by Filipino alternative rock group Eraserheads in 1994. Hits from Circus are "Alapaap", "Sembreak", "Kailan" (originally a musical number from the play Manhid by Auraeus Solito), "Magasin", and "With a Smile". It is also the last album of the band with singles released in the vinyl record format.
The album was reissued by Sony-BMG Entertainment in 2006. This is the first album that uses an inverted letter E, a notable trademark of the band. The album cover was created by visual artist Mark Justiniani. The original artwork is now with the artistâ€™s son.
"Wating" is the theme song for the 1994 Filipino movie of the same name, starring Richard Gomez and Carmina Villaroel. It does not appear on the original cassette release. The last part of the song features Carmina Villaroel on vocals.
The album was re-released as a 25th anniversary remastered edition on November 15, 2019. The album was also released for the first time on vinyl as a two 45 rpm LP set and remastered by Bernie Grundman.
