Bob Roberts is a 1992 American satirical mockumentary film written, directed by, and starring Tim Robbins. It depicts the rise of Robert "Bob" Roberts Jr., a right-wing politician who is a candidate for an upcoming United States Senate election. Roberts is well financed, due mainly to past business dealings, and is well known for his folk music, which presents conservative ideas with gusto.
The film is Robbins' directorial debut and is based on a short segment of the same title and featuring the same character that Robbins portrayed on Saturday Night Live. It marked Jack Black's film debut.
