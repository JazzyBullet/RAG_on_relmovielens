The Outsiders is a 2023 musical with music and lyrics by Jonathan Clay and Zach Chance from the folk rock band Jamestown Revival alongside Justin Levine and a book by Adam Rapp and Levine. It is based on the novel The Outsiders, first published in 1967 and written by S. E. Hinton, and on its 1983 film adaptation written by Kathleen Rowell and directed by Francis Ford Coppola. In 1990, playwright Christopher Sergel published a straight play version of the story.
The musical, told from the perspective of 14-year-old Ponyboy Curtis, is set in Tulsa, Oklahoma during the 1960s and follows the conflict between two rival gangs divided by their socioeconomic status: the working-class "Greasers" and the upper-middle-class "Socs" (pronounced â€”short for Socials).
The show received mixed-to-positive reviews, with most of the praise directed towards the script, choreography and Brody Grant's performance as Ponyboy. It received 12 nominations at the 77th Tony Awards, including Best Musical.
