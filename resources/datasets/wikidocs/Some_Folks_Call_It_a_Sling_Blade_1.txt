== Overview ==
Thornton plays Karl Childers, an intellectually disabled man who has been in a mental hospital for the past 25 years for murdering his mother and her lover. On the day of his release, he is interviewed by a reporter, Theresa Tatum (Molly Ringwald), who is writing an article with the intent of examining whether criminals judged to be insane should be released. Before the interview, Tatum is of the opinion that criminals like Childers should never be released. During the interview, however, Tatum must question her previous beliefs.
The title of the film comes from Childers's description of the murders. He admits to committing murder with a kaiser blade: "Some folks call it a sling blade, I call it a Kaiser blade."
