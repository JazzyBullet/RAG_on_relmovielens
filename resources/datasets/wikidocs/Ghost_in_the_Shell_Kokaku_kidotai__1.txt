Ghost in the Shell (Japanese: 攻殻機動隊, Hepburn: Kōkaku Kidōtai, lit. 'Mobile Armored Riot Police') is a Japanese manga written and illustrated by Masamune Shirow, which spawned the media franchise of the same name. It was first serialized in Kodansha's seinen manga magazine Young Magazine Zōkan Kaizokuban from 1989 to 1991, under the subtitle of The Ghost in the Shell, and was compiled in one tankōbon volume. Set in the mid-21st-century, it tells the story of the fictional counter-cyberterrorist organization Public Security Section 9, led by protagonist Major Motoko Kusanagi. 
The manga was followed by two sequels, Ghost in the Shell 1.5: Human-Error Processor, and Ghost in the Shell 2: Man-Machine Interface.
The mangas contain Shirow's thoughts on design and philosophy, including sociological issues, the consequences of technological advances and themes on the nature of consciousness and identity. Several artbooks have been released to detail the concept art and the world of Ghost in the Shell. All three volumes have received mainly positive reviews.
