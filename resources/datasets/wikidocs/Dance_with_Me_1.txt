Aaron Charles Carter (December 7, 1987 – November 5, 2022) was an American singer and rapper. He came to fame as a teen pop singer in the late 1990s, establishing himself as a star among preteen and teenage audiences during the first years of the 21st century, with his four studio albums.
Carter began performing at age seven, after the formation of his brother Nick's group the Backstreet Boys, and released his self-titled debut album in 1997 at age nine, selling a million copies worldwide. His second album Aaron's Party (Come Get It) (2000) sold three million copies in the United States, and Carter began making guest appearances on Nickelodeon and touring with the Backstreet Boys shortly after the record's release. Carter's next album, Oh Aaron, also went platinum, and in 2002 he released what would be his last studio album for over 15 years, Another Earthquake!, followed by his 2003 Most Requested Hits collection.
Carter appeared on Dancing with the Stars, and in the Broadway musical Seussical and the off-Broadway musical The Fantasticks, and made several one-off performances. In 2014, he released a single featuring rapper Pat SoLo, "Ooh Wee". Carter released the single "Fool's Gold" in 2016, and an EP titled Love in 2017. His fifth studio album, also titled Love, was released in 2018. A sixth album, Blacklisted, was released two days after his accidental drug-related death.


== Early life ==
Aaron Charles Carter was born on December 7, 1987 in Tampa, Florida. His parents, Jane Eleonora Schneck (née Spaulding, previously Carter) and Robert Gene Carter (1952–2017), ran a retirement home. He had an older brother, Nick, a member of the Backstreet Boys, and three sisters: his twin, Angel, a model; Bobbie Jean (BJ) (1982–2023); and Leslie (1986–2012). In addition to his full siblings, he also had an older half-sister, Ginger Lee Carter (1972–2023), and a younger half-brother, Kaden Carter.  The family was originally from Jamestown, New York. Carter attended the Frank D. Miles Elementary School and the Ruskin School in Florida.
His parents divorced in 2004. Carter was told about the divorce an hour before he filmed his MTV Cribs episode. According to the California Child Actor's Bill, Carter's parents were supposed to have put 15% of his earnings into a Coogan Account. Per Carter, "I got, like, $2 million when I turned 18 years old. I should have had at least $20 million in my account." After he turned 18 in 2005, Carter learned that he owed $4 million in tax liens. Carter claimed that his earnings had helped his parents to purchase 15 houses and 30 cars; however, he did not get any portion of profits when his parents sold the properties. He also claimed that his father shot a .44 Magnum near his ear, which caused him to go 70% deaf in one ear, to coerce him into signing a $256,000 check.
Carter also had a tumultuous relationship with his siblings, and many of their feuds have played out on social media in later years. In September 2019, Carter made allegations of sexual abuse against his sister Leslie, who died of a drug overdose in 2012, saying that the abuse began when he was ten years old and ended when he was 13, and occurred when Leslie would fail to take her prescribed medication for her bipolar disorder. He also accused his brother Nick of life-long abuse, and implied that Nick also abused a female family member. Nick's legal team denied the allegations, which came after Nick and their sister Angel sought restraining orders against Aaron, who reportedly confessed that he had thoughts of killing Nick's then-pregnant wife, Lauren.
