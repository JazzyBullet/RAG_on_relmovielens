The Devil and Max Devlin is a 1981 American fantasyâ€“comedy film produced by Walt Disney Productions, directed by Steven Hilliard Stern and starring Elliott Gould, Bill Cosby and Susan Anspach.
The film was considered to be controversial for a Disney film at the time, partly because of the subject matter, but also because of Bill Cosby's atypical portrayal of a villainous character.  This film was one of three that influenced Disney to establish Touchstone and Hollywood Pictures as an avenue to produce and release films for mature audiences.
