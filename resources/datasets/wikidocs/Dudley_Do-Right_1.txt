Dudley Do-Right is a fictional character created by Alex Anderson, Chris Hayward, Allan Burns,  Jay Ward, and Bill Scott, who appears as the main protagonist of "Dudley Do-Right of the Mounties", a segment on The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show.
The segment parodies early 20th-century melodrama and silent film (the "Northern"), using only a piano as a musical background.
Dudley Do-Right's first appearance specifically incorporates silent film tropes such as intertitles and iris shots, as well as incorporating a similar plot to 1921 silent film O'Malley of the Mounted, starring William S. Hart.
