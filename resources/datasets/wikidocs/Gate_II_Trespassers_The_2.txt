The Gate is a 1987 supernatural horror film directed by Tibor Tak√°cs and starring Stephen Dorff in his film debut. The film follows two young boys who accidentally release a horde of demons from their backyard through a large hole in the ground.
An international co-production between Canada and the United States, the film was released by the New Century Vista Film Company and grossed around twice its budget. Since its release, it has obtained a cult following and was followed by a sequel in 1990 titled The Gate II: Trespassers.
A 3D-remake directed by Alex Winter was in production; it was initially set for a release in 2011, but no release occurred at that time.
