Of Love and Shadows (Spanish: De amor y de sombra) is a novel written by Chilean novelist Isabel Allende in 1984. The plotline was inspired by journalistic accounts taken from magazines, newspapers, and interviews that Allende herself gathered both working as a journalist in Chile before her exile and during her later career as a writer in Venezuela.
