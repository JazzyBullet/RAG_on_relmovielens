== Reception ==
The film received mostly mixed reviews, holding only a 50% on Rotten Tomatoes, though Robert Duvall's performance was widely praised. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, "The movie may be worth seeing for (Robert Duvall's) performance, but the story itself is disappointing; it seems to travel around the same track once too often, and when the payoff comes, it seems short-circuited." Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote, "Duvall's performance, however, is frankly on a different level than anything else in the film...With his innate ability to create people whole, to make his familiar mannerisms and gestures work effectively in every situation, Duvall is an actor to wonder at. Although it is not within his power to save the picture."
