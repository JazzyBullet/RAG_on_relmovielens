Tierna la Noche is the second studio album by Mexican singer Fey, released on 16 November 1996, through Sony Music Entertainment Mexico. After its release, it quickly climbed the charts to later peak at the top spot. The album stayed there for more than 3 months and stayed in the Top 20 for more than 40 weeks.

"Azúcar Amargo", the album's first single, peaked at #1 in most countries in Latin America, and did fairly well in the U.S. Latin tracks. All the songs in the album received airplay, even though only 2 official videos were made.
The album made the U.S. Latin Albums Top 10 and Fey also had all four of her singles chart within the Latin Tracks Top 20 (Azucar Amargo #8, Muevelo #9, Las Lagrimas de mi Almohada #13 and Subidon #20). It won the Pop Album of the Year at the 1998 Latin Billboard Music Awards. Tierna la Noche has sold more than 4,000,000 copies worldwide.
