The Enchanted April is a 1922 novel by British writer Elizabeth von Arnim.  The work was inspired by a month-long holiday to the Italian Riviera, probably the most widely read (as an English and American best seller in 1923) and perhaps the lightest and most ebullient of her novels.
Von Arnim wrote and set the book in the 15th century Castello Brown.  Critic Terence de Vere White credited The Enchanted April with making the Italian resort of Portofino fashionable.
