The Brother from Another Planet is a 1984 low-budget American science fiction film, written and directed by John Sayles. 
The film, starring Joe Morton as an escaped extraterrestrial slave trying to find a new life on Earth, is in the public domain. Morton's performance as The Brother was acclaimed, as he had no lines of dialogue and had to communicate through facial expressions and body language alone.
