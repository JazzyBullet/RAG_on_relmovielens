Walk the Moon (stylized as WALK THE MOON) is an American pop rock band based in Cincinnati, Ohio. Lead singer Nicholas Petricca started the band in 2006, while a student at Kenyon College, deriving the band's name from the song "Walking on the Moon" by The Police. Although the band is best known for their most successful hit single to date "Shut Up and Dance", other notable songs include "Anna Sun" and "One Foot".
Walk the Moon has cited Talking Heads as influences. The band's use of 1980s musical mainstays, such as keyboard and synthesizer, is also notable.
