Psycho Beach Party is a 2000 comedy horror film based on the off-Broadway play of the same name, directed by Robert Lee King. Charles Busch wrote both the original play and the screenplay. As the title suggests, Psycho Beach Party, set in 1962 Malibu Beach, is a parody of 1950s’ psychodramas, 1960s’ beach movies, and 1980s’ slasher films.
In the film, a female surfer with multiple personalities is suspected to be the serial killer responsible for the latest series of murders in Malibu, California.
