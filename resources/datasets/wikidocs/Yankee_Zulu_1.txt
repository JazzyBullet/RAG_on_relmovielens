There's a Zulu On My Stoep, known as Yankee Zulu internationally, is a South African comedy film directed by Gray Hofmeyr. Released in 1993, the film is the highest grossing South African film in the country's box office history. The film stars Leon Schuster (who also cowrote the screenplay with Hofmeyr) and John Matshikiza as two former friends, one white and one black, who grew up together during apartheid, later reuniting as adults over a winning lottery ticket, while being pursued by a racist organization.
While the film was successful at the box office, it has been criticized for its immature slapstick humor and treatment of racism. The film is also controversial for featuring blackface and whiteface.
After the film got released in theaters, it was released first on VHS in 1994 by Ster-Kinekor Home Entertainment and later on DVD in 2004, and a reprint of the film was released in 2009 by Nu Metro Home Entertainment and M-Net.
