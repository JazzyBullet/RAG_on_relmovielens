House Party 2 is a 1991 American comedy film and the sequel to the 1990 film House Party released by New Line Cinema. The film returns most of the cast of the first film such as Kid 'n Play, Full Force, Tisha Campbell, and Martin Lawrence along with new cast members such as Iman, Queen Latifah, and Georg Stanford Brown and more guest appearances by other famous entertainers, such as Tony! Toni! Ton√©! and Ralph Tresvant. The film is directed by Doug McHenry and George Jackson in their directorial debut.
In contrast to the original, House Party 2 doesn't focus more on the party aspect of the plot. Instead, it focuses more on the characters' personal lives ranging from dating to education and career ambitions. The titular festivities, this time around, is a college pajama party instead of a high school house party.
The film is dedicated to the memory of Robin Harris, who played Pops in the first film and died nine days after the first film's release. As a result of Harris' death, his character Christopher "Pop" Robinson Sr. died before the events of this film.
