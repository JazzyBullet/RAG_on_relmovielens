Chasers is a 1994 American comedy film directed by Dennis Hopper. It is about a pair of United States Navy shore patrollers (SPs) (Tom Berenger and William McNamara) who must escort a beautiful prisoner (Erika Eleniak), and the troubles they encounter. This was the last feature-length film that Hopper directed. Chasers received mixed reviews from critics and was a box office flop, grossing just $1.6 million against a production budget of $15 million.
