What Happened to the Heart? is the upcoming fourth studio album by Norwegian singer-songwriter and record producer Aurora, set for release on 7 June 2024 through Decca, Glassnote and Petroleum Records. Written and recorded between Norway, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States, Aurora worked with Ane Brun, Matias Tellez, Tom Rowlands, Chris Greatti, Dave Hamelin and Magnus Skylstad on its production.
Aurora began working on What Happened to the Heart? during a tour in promotion of The Gods We Can Touch, and conceived the album as a cathartic process. It has been preceded by the release of three singles, "Your Blood", "The Conflict of the Mind", and "Some Type of Skin", as well as the promotional single "To Be Alright". To promote the album, Aurora will embark on a European and American headlining concert tour between June and December 2024.
