Gridlock'd is a 1997 American black comedy crime film written and directed by Vondie Curtis-Hall, and starring Tupac Shakur, Tim Roth, Lucy Liu and Thandiwe Newton. It was the directorial debut of Curtis-Hall, who also has a small role in the film. The film's opening was relatively low, despite critical acclaim; its opening weekend netted only $2,678,372 and it finished with a little over $5.5 million. Shakur died four months before the film's release.
The film focuses on two heroin addicts who decide to kick the habit, following the overdose of their bandmate. They have to face encounters with the police and local criminals, while bureaucracy prevents them from entering a drug rehabilitation program.
