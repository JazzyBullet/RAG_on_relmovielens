"Faster Kill Pussycat" is the first single from British producer Oakenfold's second studio album, A Lively Mind (2006). The song features American actress Brittany Murphy's vocals and was co-written by singer-songwriter Kelli Ali (former vocalist of British trip hop group Sneaker Pimps). The title of the track is a play on the title of the movie Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!.
"Faster Kill Pussycat" peaked at number seven on the UK Singles Chart in June 2006, becoming Murphy's highest-charting single in Britain. Outside the United Kingdom, the single reached number one on the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart and number two on the Billboard Hot Dance Airplay chart. It also peaked within the top 20 on the charts of Ireland and New Zealand.
