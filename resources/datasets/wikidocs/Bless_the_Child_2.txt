"Bless the Child" is the seventh single by Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish, released as the second single from their album Century Child. It is one of two songs which were filmed from the Century Child album, with other one being "End of All Hope". It was also the first song bassist/vocalist Marko Hietala worked on after he joined the band replacing Sami Vänskä.
There are two versions of the single, each having a slightly different track list. The normal release includes the title track and the two songs, "Lagoon" and "The Wayfarer", which have not been released in Germany before. There is too a limited DVD plus of the single which includes three DVD videotracks in addition to the audio content. The videos are "Over the Hills and Far Away", "Bless the Child", and a 30-minute interview.
In addition to it being a single, part of the edited version was used in a Chinese broadcast on CCTV-4.
