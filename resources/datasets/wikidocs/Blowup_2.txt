In mathematics, blowing up or blowup is a type of geometric transformation which replaces a subspace of a given space with the space of all directions pointing out of that subspace. For example, the blowup of a point in a plane replaces the point with the projectivized tangent space at that point. The metaphor is that of zooming in on a photograph to enlarge part of the picture, rather than referring to an explosion.
Blowups are the most fundamental transformation in birational geometry, because every birational morphism between projective varieties is a blowup.  The weak factorization theorem says that every birational map can be factored as a composition of particularly simple blowups.  The Cremona group, the group of birational automorphisms of the plane, is generated by blowups.
Besides their importance in describing birational transformations, blowups are also an important way of constructing new spaces.  For instance, most procedures for resolution of singularities proceed by blowing up singularities until they become smooth.  A consequence of this is that blowups can be used to resolve the singularities of birational maps.
Classically, blowups were defined extrinsically, by first defining the blowup on spaces such as projective space using an explicit construction in coordinates and then defining blowups on other spaces in terms of an embedding.  This is reflected in some of the terminology, such as the classical term monoidal transformation.  Contemporary algebraic geometry treats blowing up as an intrinsic operation on an algebraic variety. From this perspective, a blowup is the universal (in the sense of category theory) way to turn a subvariety into a Cartier divisor.
A blowup can also be called monoidal transformation, locally quadratic transformation, dilatation, σ-process, or Hopf map.


== The blowup of a point in a plane ==
The simplest case of a blowup is the blowup of a point in a plane. Most of the general features of blowing up can be seen in this example.
The blowup has a synthetic description as an incidence correspondence.  Recall that the Grassmannian G(1,2) parametrizes the set of all lines through a point in the plane.  The blowup of the projective plane P2 at the point P, which we will denote X, is

  
    
      
        X
        =
        {
        (
        Q
        ,
        ℓ
        )
        ∣
        P
        ,
        
        Q
        ∈
        ℓ
        }
        ⊆
        
          
            P
          
          
            2
          
        
        ×
        
          G
        
        (
        1
        ,
        2
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle X=\{(Q,\ell )\mid P,\,Q\in \ell \}\subseteq \mathbf {P} ^{2}\times \mathbf {G} (1,2).}
  

Here Q denotes another point and 
  
    
      
        ℓ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ell }
  
 is an element of the Grassmannian. X is a projective variety because it is a closed subvariety of a product of projective varieties.  It comes with a natural morphism π to P2 that takes the pair 
  
    
      
        (
        Q
        ,
        ℓ
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (Q,\ell )}
  
 to Q.  This morphism is an isomorphism on the open subset of all points 
  
    
      
        (
        Q
        ,
        ℓ
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (Q,\ell )}
  
 with Q ≠ P because the line 
  
    
      
        ℓ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ell }
  
 is determined by those two points.  When Q = P, however, the line 
  
    
      
        ℓ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ell }
  
 can be any line through P.  These lines correspond to the space of directions through P, which is isomorphic to P1. This P1 is called the exceptional divisor, and by definition it is the projectivized normal space at P. Because P is a point, the normal space is the same as the tangent space, so the exceptional divisor is isomorphic to the projectivized tangent space at P.
To give coordinates on the blowup, we can
