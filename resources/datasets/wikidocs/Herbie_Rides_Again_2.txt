Herbie, the Love Bug is a sentient 1963 Volkswagen Beetle which has been featured in several Walt Disney motion pictures starting with the The Love Bug in 1969. As the protagonist it has a mind of its own, being capable of driving itself and often becoming a serious contender in auto racing. Throughout most of the films it is distinguished by red, white, and blue racing stripes from the front to the back bumper, a pearl white body, a racing-style number "53" on the front luggage compartment lid, doors, engine lid, and a yellow-on-black 1963 California license plate with the registration "OFP 857".
