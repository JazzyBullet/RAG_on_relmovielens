Endless Summer Vacation is the eighth studio album by American singer Miley Cyrus, released on March 10, 2023, via Columbia Records. It is her first new body of work since leaving RCA Records after her seventh studio album Plastic Hearts (2020) and signing with Columbia in early 2021. A pop and dance-pop record, Endless Summer Vacation is a shift from the synth-pop, rock, and glam rock genres featured on Plastic Hearts. Cyrus related its overall concept to her affection for Los Angeles, where the album was mainly recorded, and its track sequencing to the course of a day. Brandi Carlile and Sia are featured as guest vocalists.
The album was supported by three singles. The lead single, "Flowers", set several streaming and chart records and spent eight weeks atop the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, marking Cyrus' second number-one in the country, and topped the charts in 36 other countries. The second and third singles "River" and "Jaded" followed in March and April, respectively. A digital edition of the album featuring the fourth single, "Used to Be Young", was released in August. With its release, Endless Summer Vacation became Cyrus's first album to feature multiple US top-ten singles since Bangerz (2013).
Upon release, Endless Summer Vacation received praise from music critics, who complimented its production, commercial appeal, and Cyrus' vocal performance. Commercially, it reached number-one in ten countries and the top 10 in 17 countries. The album was nominated for Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards, whilst "Flowers" won Record of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance.
Cyrus performed eight of the twelve tracks for the Disney+ documentary concert special Endless Summer Vacation (Backyard Sessions), which was released on March 10, 2023. An updated version of the special was broadcast on ABC on August 24, 2023, and released on Hulu the day after.
