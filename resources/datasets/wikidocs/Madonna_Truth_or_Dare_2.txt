Initially the line launched with handbags, footwear, accessories, intimates and fragrances.
The brand's primary demographic was women in the age range of 27â€“50 and its commodities would include a variety of apparel. In March 2012, the second product, women's footwear was announced to be launched in the fall of 2012 in association with ALDO Group. The first product released was a perfume of the same name, released by Coty, Inc. and launched in the United States in April 2012 exclusively to Macy's departmental stores, and globally in May 2012. Madonna wanted to create a contemporary version of her mother's fragrance, and collaborated with perfume maker Stephen Nilsen. She collaborated with Fabien Baron on the promotional activities.
