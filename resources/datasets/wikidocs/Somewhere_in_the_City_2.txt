Writing for Pitchfork, Ian Cohen liked the album stating how everything they had released before this had felt meaningless and unserious with this album giving them a newfound purpose. He stated that Somewhere City is an invigorating album to listen to for half an hour. Leor Galil for Chicago Reader complimented the album's energy, saying "Heagy and Doherty use their instrumental skills to work flamboyant, sometimes playful parts into neat, hook-filled songs, lending emotional resonance to what might otherwise seem like merely athletic displays."
